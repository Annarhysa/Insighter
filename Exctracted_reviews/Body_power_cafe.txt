Tofu was hard


food quality is compromised.. started feeling upset tummy after consuming this food

great food


spoiled food.
very bland and undercooked food







waste of money
marvelous food i really enjoyed
and everything is balance so well
As dosa's size is small, 3 instead of 2 can be better. Apart from that, everything is good(taste, presentation, packaging). Will order again. Thanks to chef.
Not good nor too bad , just average

the only positives are
1) Whole wheat base ‚≠ê
2) Paneer Tikka pieces ‚≠ê

the negatives are
1) The price they have quoted for this item is huge for 4 slices of pizza
2) Base not baked well
3) Very less veggies on the pizza
4) It didn't felt like eating a pizza
excellentüíØüëçüëè everything balanced
Pizza was waste of money. It was soft and too cold, not eatable
superb calories food I was taking food everyday from here and Im maintaining good diet with good food health
the curry smell is bad and it has sour, bad taste. it's not fresh and it seems like a day before one.

recieved wrong order- asked for dark chocolate donuts and got mocha donuts, and the taste was aweful while the bun was too chewy for a donut
I order chicken and tofu. I only got chicken.
Chutney not fresh

not at all good




Pretty bad, def not worth the money
very less quantity at that price point

Pricing are bit higher, food is okay


taste was good
Great packaging and fresh food.



Nice one





Taste
very very less rice served, not enough for 1 person
soggy base



Too much pricey
