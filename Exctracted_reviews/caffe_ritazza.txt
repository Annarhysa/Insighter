Perfect ambience for a cafe in a mall. Spinach corn sandwich is highly recommended. Special mention to the light roast specials.
Possibly the best coffee that I have had in this part of Hyderabad in a long time. The Aglio olio was done to perfection and the garlic bread brought back memories of the erstwhile Pizza Hut days when they used to make real good bread. Pizza Hut stopped that around 10 years ago or so( I mean the quality and taste). Cafe Ritazza does the garlic bread than anyone else. Reasonable prices, prompt service and a chilled out vibe. A must try for all coffee lovers.
It's my go to place in the mall. The food, ambiance, service are excellent.. and it's a good break in between shopping!!
Cafe Mocha was our order and it tasted decent. Not top notch maybe, but did work for my headache. Would visit again💯


You will see a lot of fly all over place.


She s not at all responsive and rude

Quesadilla was really bad. Time to serve 1 hour.

Pizzas are good. Sandwiches are also good. Panini sandwich is great.



Food is good and taste yummy!!!
I love ritazza coffee






Tasty fish fingers & fried fish burger. Do try their daily menu. Coffee was fine, nothing exceptional. Want to try their pizza next time.






We stopped for a small snacks here, tried pasta arabiata. I'm not sure how the original recipe is, however what we got is something super spicy and oily stuff. You can see the leftover oil in the photo. Also as per the menu, it is supposed to contain olives and cherry tomatoes...well you have to stretch your imagination hard to find those in the dish.

The cuppucino and the drip coffee was good.
A good place to have your quick meals after having a tiring day shopping in the mall. Situated inside of Sarath City Capital Mall, this cafe will serve you some good quality coffee at a reasonable price. Excellent quality of sandwiches and Thin Crust Pizzas. Do try if you're in an around Kondapur, Hyderabad.

Went here for a green tea while we were shopping at Sarath City Mall. I must say that their service is very good. They didn’t have what I exactly wanted, but then they obliged and whipped it up for us. I could enjoy a cup of refreshing green tea after a hectic day shopping. The ambiance is warm and relaxing. I’m yet to try their sandwiches and other delectable stuff mentioned in reviews.

While we were sitting here, I noticed that the girl making the ice teas and mochas was mixing the drinks with a long stem stirrer which had a spoon on the other end. She would confidently taste the drink with the spoon and place it back on the counter (behind the cashier), to be used for the next...read more
The sandwiches here are very good! You can tell that the quality of cheese and bread are better than the chain restaurants.
In addition, the caffe is a great spot to relax in Sarath city mall. I definitely recommend this over the foodcourt hustle
Very good food and best coffe.
Coffee is very good. I have been multiple times to the caffe when ever i go sarath city mall i visit the store.
Tried the veg burger and veg ravioli today. The burger bun was amazingly soft and fresh. The overall burger was yumm too.. the ravioli was also very nicely made but I wish they gave a little more quantity. It would be worth the price then.


The staff of this place is very humble but lack knowledge of different payment methods supported and the offers going on via online platforms. The pizza tastes good but is overpriced. Seating inside the cafe is good.
Was sceptical to initially try this place as I felt it would be an commercial brand with no quality as I always prefer gourmet coffee shops over commercial ones but was totally surprised when I tried this cafe today, they have a wide selection of good food and coffee. I tried coffee made in syphon filter which was very fancy and tried cottage cheese sandwich on baguette which was decent as well, though the baguette can be improved as it had a soft crust. The staff were very courteous and welcoming, Overall very happy with the experience and would drop in again to try their other offerings.
Good place to sit and relax after too much shopping in mall.
I ordered lychee lavender ice tea, Signature coffee frappe, Potato wedges, Garden fresh pizza.
Lychee lavender ice tea was ok could only taste lycee and no lavender flavour
Their signature coffee frappe was too good loved it must try,
Garden fresh pizza is just awesome cheese with lots of vegetables like zucchini, mushroom, broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes, bell pepper and babycorn. For sure I will have the same pizza again on my next visit.
Potato wedges are too good thick and crispy and taste so delicious
Very courteous and helpful staff, good service.
Love this place... Will come again😊

Had gone to Cafe Ritazza to grab some snacks and coffee after a days shopping. First of all the the place is quite spacious with a lovely ambience and highly courteous staff. We had the following items and loved each and every bit of them

Caramel Cappuccino (5/5)
- Strong, Refershing, Nicely Caramelised

Signature Cappuccino (5/5)
- Perfectly Roasted, Aromatic

Fruit Bowl with Yoghurt (5/5)
- Fresh Fruits, Healthy, Delicious

Chicken Sandwich (4/5)
- Tasty, Great flavours

Overall the experience was amazing, a great place to chill out and refresh yourself after a days shopping. Loved the service and experience.
Been to this place a month ago, I still remember how much I relished the food. The staff is courteous and their suggestions based on our taste is bang on! Loved signature coffee! Can’t wait to visit again.
Just in one phrase - yum yum yum in my tum! :)
The UK based Caffè Ritazza chain has opened a new outlet in Sarath City Mall, Kondapur. The Café is spacious and the ambience is welcoming.

Also, there are a number of board games to keep you occupied while your order is being prepared. The staff is also polite and the service is top class.

Things tried:
Nutella Hot Chocolate: Hot Chocolates are one of my favorite and this one didn’t disappoint at all. This was on par with the ones you get at other places.

I tried the baguettes both the veg and non veg, they were quite okay and could definitely be improved.

Loved the cafe frappe as well. Very hospitable and friendly staff with lots of board games available which managed to keep my little one engaged. I will definetly go back there again


We visited the place for the first time as the ambience was catchy.. ordered pizza, coffee and Oreo frappe... The pizza was amazing. Certain toppings were added on our request. The staff is really courteous and helpful. On discussion regarding some coffee, they made us taste their signature drink as a gesture.. pizza was really cheesy and special. Afreen served us... Satish and the manager took good care of us ..... A must visit place.... For having a bite at Cafe.....

The coffee was excellent. Beats CCD and starbucks hands down. The cheesy garlic bread was also quite nice. Very nice ambience. Would highly recommend.

We had garlic cheesy bread, bbq wings and chicken penne arrabiata, frappe and americano and the winner was pasta- simple dish but elegant taste. Every bit of pasta and sauce we joined.

Had to visit for a coffee to this place. Maintained clean with proper sanitization by manager Siva Kumar, kudos to his knowledge in making the perfect coffee and he explained about Expresso, Americano and all chocie of flavors. Will visit again with family post covid.

Right in the middle of the mall, nice ambience & food.

However they must take care of the queue management and ensure they take the order in queue.
