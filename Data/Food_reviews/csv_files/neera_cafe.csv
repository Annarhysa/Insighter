"Neera, too costly and don't know why it is so sweet. Usually in Villages, it doesn't taste much sweet. In Villages we 1 litre toody for ‚Çπ70-100. It's ‚Çπ.90/- for 300 ml. Quantity is less."

"Very nicely built, there are various other outlets such as pista house and scoops apart from the Neera counter."
Place and ambience was wonderful. ‚Ä¶
Serene atmosphere and the place is very nice to look at and spend sometime. Been there on a weekday so did not get to see how crowded it can be. Neera tastes good and the staff are helping and coordial. One can't believe it is maintained so ‚Ä¶
Neera cafe is one of the Hyderabad‚Äôs first drinking spot of healthy beverage. It became one of the popular drink in Telangana. The cafe is pretty cool with the architecture. Ambiance is good. It‚Äôs good spot to spent time in the evening. Have a visit and enjoy.

"I recently visited the government-owned store selling Neera palm nectar, and I must say, it's a hidden gem! The pure, unadulterated sweetness of this palm tree nectar is a delight for the taste buds. Not only is Neera a healthier ‚Ä¶"
1bottel 90rs.... simply superb  
Atmosphere also sooo cool..üòç ‚Ä¶
Neera taste was really nice. 90 rupees for 300 ml.
It doesn't taste or smell like alcohol at all. Nice lake view atmosphere with good parking area along with nice sitting area ‚Ä¶
"The atmosphere here is good. But the prices are not affordable. You know the government had redefined the word called ""neera"". According to village people neera is a medicinal drink which is served straight away from the trees in the ‚Ä¶"
"Neera Cafe First in Hyderabad Open today (3rd May 23) Inaugurated by KT Rama Rao Sir , Neera Cafe is built at a cost of Rs 13 crore, capacity to accommodate 300 to 500 people. The roof has been designed in the shape of a palm leaf, ‚Ä¶"
Neera cost is too high compared to local market. OK-OK types sitting arrangement and outside courtyard.
Please don't keep any high expectations.
This is an initiative by the Telangana Tourism to promote the natural sap from palmyra trees as a health drink and thereby encourage and ensure financial sustenance to the widespread toddy tappers' community. We went there on a Sunday afternoon and unfortunately the stock got over well before time - poor planning and execution.
New 0% Alcoholic beverage in town !!!
Happen to visit this place for the first time since their opening. ‚Ä¶

"I felt it added sugar...does not meet the original neera.  There was a store  called  Telangana Pindi vantalu, The snacks we bought were not tasty at all."

"Neera drink is definitely worth a try due to its immense health benefits. Only point of observation which needs be properly implemented is, on every bottle served there is a bottling date on which no date has been specified. Though makers ‚Ä¶"
It's open till 9PM but the stock lasts only till 4-5PM due to its high demand. I suggest y'all to visit this place before 4PM.
 ‚Ä¶
A cool place to hang out with friends
Neera products are mostly Out of stock ‚Ä¶
90- per one neera bottle.
Tastes like bleaching powder + coconut water.
I don't really know about the nutrition facts but yeah you can hardly like it's ‚Ä¶
"Went there in second week of July. Don't expect neera to have the same taste of pure toddy. It was more like enhanced version of coconut juice.  Cost was around 90 rs for 300 ml, which is on a higher side for me, considering we would get a liter for around 200 in outskirts of hyderabad."
 ‚Ä¶
Had neera of one small bottle. It's is costly rs 190. It's like coconut water with sugar after fermentation. Not as expected. But the Hussain Sagar view is good. Bouquet hall is there. 3-4 shops includes pista house and Telangana ‚Ä¶
Its an exclusive cafe for neera(a drink with lots of health benefits).
There are few others restaurants nearby food n drinks.
Place is not crowded usually. ‚Ä¶
"Can try once , it's just like sugarcane juice with more sweeter"
Timing is only after 12
Don't go before
Timing is 12pm-5pm
Can take a ride to the Buddha statye
200ml bottle cost ‚Çπ100/-
"Best place to get the natural sap in the city, especially for summers."
"This is a good place for boating in Hussain Sagar within 50/- per person which is pocket friendly. We can visit the budha statue also in this trip. There are very less food stalls here. Food stalls can be added. I didn't visit the neera stall so I have no idea on that. Overall, it's a good place for boating in my opinion."
Food: 3/5
"If you like thati munjalu, you will like the drink taste. Taste is refreshing."
Bottling company date was not mentioned on bottle but expiry date was mentioned as 3 days from bottling. ü§∑

Most overrated . But  nice thinking govt . If the price of neera will be 40-50 between almost every person who comes first time will  buy for the present cost. But if price less means every person will try 2-3  bottles. ‚Ä¶
