"the press and spinh was good when visited directly. I don't want why they r spoiling their name in online orders.. in yogurt mix fruit bowl there is no yogurt at all...the pasta also was very bad when ordered online..during my direct visit ,it was very tasty..pls don't spoil your name by providing incomplete service and not tasty food..I had recommended ur place to my frnds as well"
I couldn't know if it was really a pasta that I ordered. Food quality was awful. Service was even worse. Took more than an hour to deliver.
"What a lovely healthy food cafe with many diversified food options with very good ambience. Salads, Cold Pressed Juices and Super Healthy Smoothies are awesome, tasty and healthy."
