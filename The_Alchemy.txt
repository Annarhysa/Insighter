butter pav tastes like mustard oil. dahi bhalla was not good.
Ordered items not delivered

The quality of food was pathetic and Aloo tikki had a very foul smell.
It looked like it was made of bad/rotten potatoes. Terrible taste and smell. Worst experience ever!
Did not send the extra pav I had ordered with the food.
Panipuri very salty.
