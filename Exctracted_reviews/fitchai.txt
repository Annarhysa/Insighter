awesome taste
nothing
ok

taste is good
Totally tasteless
No salt, no spice, and bread was sweet. Never had such tasteless omelette
the bottle was squeezed and damaged.

The tea tasted like it was burnt

I've complained about chai quality to their kondapur outlet too and then the owner was starting to tell me the maching process to make this fine product. wow

the packing did not match the image

I went with my pals, we had classy experience.. Great customer service...!! So many healthy options  such as fit tea for healthy freaks & so on...!  sandwiches are just yummmmm.... Pizza pockets are filling and to my surprise they have ayurvedic and healthy shakes... Must try option... would love to revisit again and again

Tried Golden milkshake and tulasi milkshake !!!
Worth drinking !!!

Wonderful tea !!! Loved it

Varieties of tea are available.  They mainly focus on your calorie needs and to keep your body healthy. Staff is good. Parking is available for both cars and bike. Price is reasonable.  Ambience is OK. They are not regular teas.

I just stumbled upon this on my way to home. The name is perfect for their menu. If anyone wants to try something different with health benefits as perks. I recommend it.

It's yammi tea.....! I felt very happy after having a nice Tea....! Thank you fit chai....!

Must try golden milk very taste and healthy

Super healthy and tasty fitchai
