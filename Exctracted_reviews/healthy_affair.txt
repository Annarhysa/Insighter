Wonderful place to have health food. Crated menu very specific health option. Freshness of food is exceptional level. Very nice ambiance to match for healthy food . …More
Having tried over 6 different "healthy restaurants" in Hyderabad, I can confidently say that Healthy Affairs is the best one. The chef (Mr.Raghu) puts in a great amount of though and effort into each meal.

Every meal I've ordered has been custom prepared and is extremely customisable. They use extremely fresh and high quality ingredients which I've not seen used anywhere else.

I'd strongly recommend trying everything out on their menu, but my favourites are : The grilled chicken breast wrapped in egg white omelette, their meal box and the chocolate banana oats shake!

High recommended!
