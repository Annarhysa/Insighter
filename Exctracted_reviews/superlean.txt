extremely hard and burnt chicken. This ruined the taste of the burrito
Made me wait for 2 hours and eventually I had to cancel the order. They have not even communicated what went wrong.






The quantity is very less for the price

Taste is good but the quantity could be better.
no filling
This is so unexpected


Horrendous experience, will never try again. Not worth it for 150 gms of salad that has like 7-8 pieces of chicken.


The chicken burrito did not have more than two 1-inch pieces of fried (not grilled) chicken. The description says 40 gms of protein. With nearly zero chicken and only vegetables and rice inside this tiny wrap, this has less than 10 gms of protein. This place is a fraud!!!
in the photo they showed steaks but send 2 small pieces of fried chicken
this is the last time with this restaurant. they mentioned brow bread and baked beans. neither of them was supplied. instead some white bread and spicy omlette. total waste. Zomato should delist them from their platform

delay

keep selling food worth Rs 50 for Rs 500

Only Bread no Paneer snd other Veg. wrong calculation of Cal..

quantity is very less and very disappointed
worst food ,, chicken was very very hard and was stinking. there was a very less chicken by de way and a lot of veggies..initially I thought it was veg salad... there is no rating below one.. else I would have given .5...
saus not given
quality fell down so bad from before no chicken in chicken orders order size reduced the calorie sspecs in menu don't match the product send
low quantity

food is not fresh

there was hair in my order
make proper quality check before delivery of the food


compliments to the Chef you need to add such healthy options in your menu
Alert: This is really a bad mark on zomato that they are taking customers for granted. No point in ordering from zomato again if this gets repeated
Late as usual
keep going

The restaurant sent the wrong item
This is fooling customers saying it is chicken steak. its rice with three small chicken pieces. what nonsense
very little portion and chicken was stale and hard
full salty and sauce is worst not nice it's too bad
the grill chicken looked over burned and overall it was hopeless..
awesome food. quantity is a little disappointing...
Worst ceaser salad. 80% was bread and that too burnt. It was pathetic experience and never ordering again.
pathetic food. beans were not even cooked. worst exp.
food is cold and very less quantity of bbq chicken
very fast Service with full safety and exact time
As soon as I opened the bottle I found some dust inside the cap and on the bottle mouth in one the two bottles that I have ordered .
poor quality juices.. added lot of sugar and water
worest packing, not at all satisfied, I want refund
I had expected grilled paneer instead got fried paneer and a salad washed in Mayo. I would suggest that you provide a choice of dressing so people can pick healthier options
My tummy is happy with the Flavours but I wish the steak was lil moist
Overall good packaging and healthy food
Please don’t order this juice. It’s very bitter..
Initially superlean was excelent! But now everything has changed their food quality steak has become smaller taste has changed.
The taste was ridiculous
It was too bitter
Plz return my money
This isn't worthy
I think I was given the non veg chicken instead of paneer
good options for salad kind of food. portion size is good. chicken was crunchy. juice was just ok ok types but such juices might have this kind of taste only




extra tangy than required. less portion cannot feed one person




Since its lean food, super lean foods can keep dressing separatly and leave salad dry.. let the customer have the option to addor omit dressing

I order grill chicken I get some small piece of fried nugget and beet juice is rotten









The juice was extremely bitter though it was fresh

add meyoneae to the diet meal; I think subway option are better








The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation







On time delivery during night time ,
packing was nice,
item portion size is good,
Cilantro fish was good one, tried couple of times it tastes super
