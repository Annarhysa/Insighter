Taste was not very good... I don't know if it was because it was healthy or not of good quality
"very less portion compared to price, taste is ok compared to others"
worst taste
"EatFit has always been my go-to place for breakfasts, the variety and healthy items available there impress me"
nice packaging
very spicy
I ordered a chicken pizza and I rarely found any chicken in that
one of the worst pizza you will ever eat. murdering the flavour in the name of experimenting with different ingredients. must avoid.
salty
Quality is good but quantity is poor for the money
"Food quantity, quality and packing was good but salt was too much."
packaging can be more precise for veg and non veg. can be packed as one stack rather than individual.
Nice
very spicy

Nice
very spicy
Roti was so hard. Poor quality of soya bean sabji also
Very bad and I lost my money buy ordering I never go with Zomato rather I prefer swiggy
I have ordered 8 Gold Corn pizza ordered on buy one get one offer but I was received as one order I'm very dispointed don't play cheap stricks to customers worst service quality also not good I will suggest my friends to don't order on eat fit pls check the attached screenshot.
Taste was ok ok
Juice was worst
worst
Pizza got moist.
Taste is not that good. It can be better
"butter panner gravy is whole water, too bad, did not expect this"
taste is okay
too oily
very spicy.
millet curd rice is spicy. tender coconut water has sugar in it. don't know what's fit about that
Much prefer the Palak paneer thali. Eat fit should really change their butter paneer recipe. It‚Äôs too sweet.
They show different things and deliver different things not good don't order from this restaurant any time my suggestion
Missed an item in the order - badam kheer
the pizza was not good it smells bad
The veg burger tasted so awful. Highly disappointed.
The garlic bread basically had mayo instead of cheese.
Never ordering again.
lot of undercooked globs
roti was not good
dal makhani was not hot
Didn't receive soya masala sabzi as orderd. Instead of soya masala sabzi they have sent some ladies finger curry.
Keep up the good work. Hope you guys make healthier and more nutritional food in the future. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
a bit salt and veggies would give a great taste. pasta should be cooked a bit more. No veggies üòî
This restaurant is just a scam in the name of healthy food. For 350INR they just serve 3 tablespoons of chicken gravy with two miniature size chicken pieces and people buy it thinking it is healthy. The food is as greasy and unhealthy as other restaurants who give you a better portion size for the same price.
"what they are showing in picture is not true!!. no paratha, no salad.. dal tadka missed and paneer gravy was like the same general restaurant. Rs. 298.00 I could hv ordered from other restaurant. but one thing that I like most the ghee mung dal halwa..."
you need to improve the taste of food. othervise everything is good.

Eatfit quality is degrading day by day. Not tasty and portion is very small.

"Where is chicken, guys? All I see is gravy with peas"
"Not using right packaging can make one lose appetite, the chicken and roti came mixed. Would advice to use partition boxes from next time."

Nice food and good taste
"The delivery agent didn't reach my location, so I had to walk almost 1 km. Worst experience with Zomato"

Good taste. Generous amount of toppings.
Great taste

vegetable khichdi had no vegetables
good job
Packing is such a big mess! Half the sambar spilled all over inside the paper bag and all over my door step.
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the packing skills that are missing here or the delivery guy can‚Äôt do his job well
"Whatever it is it just made me lose my good morning vibes and wanting to eat hassle free without having to cook because I had to clean up all the mess all over my door step, my floors, my table!"
What the hell
And in the end the the food didn‚Äôt even taste good. Idlis too hard and not even hot.
Serves me right for trying to eat at a new place. I should have stuck with my earlier choices.
Not worth it.
2nd time in 2 weeks meal is not delivered and we have received msg that it is delivered. This is pathetic. No response on chatbot.

Worst. Firstly the order was too late. The pizza was cold. Toppings were not given. Didn‚Äôt give a spoon to eat ice cream. Taste was bad and horrible when its not hot.
There are hardly no pieces in the kulcha burger. More than chicken it was totally potato. Taste wasn‚Äôt that great. Wasted money by ordering it.

thank you for being on time... and super food...
The quantity was so less that you can't eat 3 paranthas with that. the taste was not good.
not worth paying for that quantity.
the curries were just half filled.
I had very good experience with eatfit HSR layout Bangalore. here it's disappointing.
The poha was tasteless and hardly 4-5 peanuts
Chutney or curd has not given with poha and I ordered 2 pc gulab jamun but in that only one piece they have given üôÑüôÑüò°
quantity was too low
5++++ Stars ü§©
worst food ever palak paneer is just not worth eating
"what is the meaning of ""8"" I have buy 1 pizza for 300 . so I would give advice don't buy this product. useless test as well. it is waste of money. go for Domino's it is value of money."
again pathetic pizza üçï
The portion size too small
less quantity
Add more quantity
Dessert item can be added too.
The food was dry and pathetic in taste
Taste was good but quantity was less... Doesn't look to be 500g
The taste was sucks this will be the last time I‚Äôm ordering

worst taste i have experienced ever.
Quantity is less
Quantity of poha could have been more
not a good test
they are not fresh
so the pasta was to good before now the pasta less vegetables soggy pasta and they dint even give cheese powder if they want to reduce the quality it's no need to order this pasta
Food was amazing
it was excellent
"neither tasty nor enough, plus the masala chas is just water with masala"
test is ok ok but without ü•ú it's is incomplete
i didn't like the taste
The picture showed Rotis but what came was Paratha that too complete Maida. Notvatvall healthy
Good one
very bad taste. Never order this.
there were no dates at all! and hardly any nuts. I have ordered from Eatfit twice before. But this time I am highly disappointed. There have to be nuts and dates in a nuts and dates pudding!
Only 1 poha was delivered
"quantity is so less ,they filled half of the cup ,seems like people ate alredy half of the halwa ,such a disspointment , shameful of the store ,need a refund imediately"
Dietary quinoa has boiled rice broken and mixed instead of complete quinoa‚Ä¶ rice is not mentioned in the ingredients list for this khichdi‚Ä¶
Not tasty. Not spicy even. Expected superb taste but not good
less dryfruits... expecting more fruit items...but it's okay
"Food delivered in cold condition,"
the quantity was very less compared to price and in the menu it's written as aloo Gobi but there was no Gobi only aloo seriously
The order was very late
gulab jamun single piece very costly. it doesn't taste good. wate of money
Uncooked paratha. Bad quality
"The coconut water felt very flavoured and not natural, Poha taste felt degraded. Qunatity of poha is less"
in the picture they are showing full. in reality quantity if just half in that.
Such a pathetic experience.
Being a frequent customer you kind f have a trust in the brand. But the order received today was beyond pathetic.
I ordered Wheat Roti which was in such a bad state and mostly importantly was stale.
it was so hard for me to chew it that at the end I had to throw it away.
pot was broken while opening phirni wasted
less quantity
Very delicious
"The taste was good, but the quantity of bhindi was very less."
Poor delivery guy had to wait for so long for this
"Cutlery was missing. Except that, good food."

The Khulches were not fresh
"40+ rupees for three small peices each of cucumber and carrot, we are looted !!"
bad bad bad test experience
item missed tender coconut water
"3.5 to be precise but the packaging and service is good so 4. Taste is fine, not that great."
Portion size is good too. Please improve your cold coffee.
"Biriyani was tasty, bowl was average."
They did not send all the items. When I called the restaurant they did not pick up my call. No body addressed my concern. No refund nothing.
Product damaged and spilled.
very bad
Homemade feeling with tasty yummy food
They gave me malai kulfi instead of caramel nuts
worst coconut water i ever had
due to late delivery food was cold.
It was good
"It was good , was able to finish my bowl !"
Increase the Portion size
worst experience üëéüëéüëé
165 Rs for this quantity?
bad quality of foor

üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üíñ to late today my order!!!
I don't understand what cabbage was doing in butter paneer kulcha
didn't bake well it was not hot and i ordered 8 slice but I received only 4
"Is this a Thali? insufficient and tasteless food, dal makani served only one spoon less than half box quality.. two Roti's that too broken... oh god... never I will order the food from zomato"
Please don‚Äôt use plastic containers for packing hot foods
Your delivery executive always reaches to wrong location and call to guide to correct location.
Also they are always rude.
Not expected atall
Nothing
add ons were missing
This is combo plate but we have to pay extra for parathas...and taste is not good
Stale food‚Ä¶not fresh. Instead of Nihari they served chicken curry. Pathetic
"Very oilyyy meal, eatfit how can we fit to eat this much oil"
meal was not properly packed
quality day by day reducing
Worst Haleem
order quality of whole wheat paratha doesn't match delivered 1 set instead of 2
Delayed delivery
wrong delivery I ordered 8 pices I get 4 pices
Great food. Made in a healthy manner
"taste is good, can improve on portion size to match the price"
"over cooked, not get good quality according to price."
The quantity of dal in my order was horrible and I even complained it zomato
It's like just water not panner
"where is peanuts , Tomato , garlic worst poha ever"
"Less quantity, parantha was dry and felt uncooked. Vegetable quantity was so low that you can finish with only one parantha."
less quantity
poha is only made of aloo
This is not sugarcane juice at all. it's just Jaggery water.
"Not good. My son couldn‚Äôt eat the Paneer Kadhai, though he loves paneer. Am myself a good enough homechef so am writing after giving a thought."
"every thing feel like,, the stuff has been freezing,, there didn't make it fresh"
I dont even want to rate it as it was so bad
I ordered two sugar cane juice but receivd only one...
I paid 69 for gulab jamun but there was only 1 piece and the taste of it was sour.Seems like old one.
Coconut water was waste of money.. ..i think it expired ...not good at all
worst curd rice ever... thrown everything into trash bin
"I have been ordering from eatfit regularly, hence this type to irresponsibility made me to rethink about ordering"
spoilt brownie and bad tasting cake

I am unable to give cooking instructions as they have not attended my call ‚Ä¶not good

"I ordered oat meal,no spoon provided i am at working site now"
how can i eat
worst experience of eating biryani.never order biryani from eatfit.paying almost 400 plus and not even single leg piece.
what a meal!
I loved each portion of it. Kudos to the chef. A perfect dish for who want to eat best veggies dinner
Exquisite!
taste was good but quantity was less. they charged 24rs for packing and the packing received was not great...
the quantity of gravy is very less
Very good food. In the menu please include greek yoghurt or normal yoghurt is possible
Good food. Brilliant packaging. Sufficient quantity. Tasty and tender content. Loving it.
good
this time the brownie is completely different...taste wise is yuck...like cheap pastries
Quality is good but it‚Äôs more pricey.
25 rs packing charges? for what? a small plastic box?
channa is spoiled
worrest eat fit
very bad how could I eat this
average
quality of Paratha was worst. quantity of halwa was less than 250gm also for Rs149 plus.
Iam a regular customer every time i will order same poha from eatfit but every time the quantity will be different today its less and sometimes lemon they will not provide today also they did not give lemon why this inconsistancy? please provide quality poha and same quality and quantity with lemon everything all times for all orders
Less quantity for the price
they need to give full bowl not a mini version where its half filled
"too less quantity no teasty , waste of money"
"See yourself the pulse quantity, are you kidding me. do you think we are fool here. Whole of my pulse is missing"
The rice was good but when it comes to the curry it was not the way I expected to be. Bhindi was a bit of soggy and chicken was having huge pieces which were uncomfortable to eat
they had added only 8 small pieces of chicken
Taste ok ok
I am not a person who usually write reviews. But I must say that I am very impressed by EatFit. They firstly have such amazing range in their menu. The healthy tasty combination is so good. I am definitely going to recommend it all my friends!
worst
The food is stale and it tasted salty
i ordered quinoa khichdi but receive rice khichdi
This is not done . I mean I ordered because I just wanted to eat the food and you changed the whole order ! I mean what ?
No topping
Rotis were not fresh
it's a Horrible Pizza i ever had in my life. This Taste made my day very bad.
very less in content.

Super tasty.
"nice packaging. good service bt when the Indian meal, specially with dal or curry need spoon not fork."
Great delivery
bad smell
No
"restaurant won't answer calls, worrest packing... from now i am not going to order from here"
The problem with packaging they are charging 25 for package to just provide in plastic box

There's sand particles in the curry. did not expect this from eat fit.

food was not cooked
Delivery was soo confusing and just because you wanted to show you arrived on time have confirmed that it‚Äôs arrived but haven‚Äôt received it .what‚Äôs the whole point of you marked it‚Äôs arrived and not delivering the order on time ??
And received the order post raising the issue .
grossly overpriced pedestrian fare
nice but too expensive
Nice trick to make the money by making fool to the customer. It seems chicken is more costlier than mutton now that's what you made me feel like.
and it took more than an hour prepare and deliver
Garvey is watery
good
Very tasty üòçüòç
It was not packed properly
very bad experience. üôèüèª
quantity of the combo meal is very less according to the price
Old stack
expensive mostly packet contains sunflower seeds just only 2to3 cashew
waste of money
It needs to be more hot!
It‚Äôs tasteless both the gravies
Thank you!!
"The taste was pathetic, quantity too is less. We got sick after eating the food."
gobi paratha is tasteless and stuffing is very dry and bad taste. please refund my amount.
it was cold and seemed that it was kept for long time
It was the worst pizza I ever ate. It's like making a home made pizza without love
not tasty
"Food was sticky, cold and bland"
"how can something hot, served in plastic be healthy? there's likely more toxins in the food because of the plastic than the value the food provides. why can't you use sustainable-biodegradable packaging?"
filling could be better as the kulcha was quite thick n fat. I thought the pesto sauce will be spread inside the kulcha burger. chips were nice hard n crispy - left as if it was tapioca and not potato
Actual food doesn‚Äôt reflect the photos or the description. Disgusted with the quality of food.
quantity is less
1 member small box serves 1
amazing would love to know recepie
please add tissue papers.
It's just 90% bread with absolutely no filling at all...
delivery boy mislead.
Please increase quantity of rice
waste
no taste its taste is like cream bun wrost wrost
guy is good
Quantity of rice is definitely not for 2 servings
Please dont make foolish attempts to make Fit Burger. It was failed totally. Portion size of meal served only one. Taste was not up to the mark at all.
it'scool
Horrible Taste n idk how its a best seller
salt more
i
very pathetic and half Cooked paratha served. very disappointing experience till now. Total wastage of money
Curry too watery. Didn‚Äôt expect this from eatfit.
quantity is very less
Overall portion size is less.
quantity was half ..very poor
what is this this is dal khichdi
very less quantity
I guess everything is cooked longtime back. They just heat it and send.
how does this chole will sufficient to have 2 kulcha
how should I rate if I can't completely eat the food I ate only 1 kulcha as the chole was very low in quantity
good but need a bit boil
Was completely cold when delivered
got a hair on the coconut water bottle....and it is very Dirty too.....truly disappointed
No salt no taste. Very sorry
quantity has been reduced a lot
"Bad experience, undercooked food"
Timely delivery
not cooked properly
the kultcha was hell cold. did not get delivered on time
"Everything about this store has turned horrible. Bad packaging, late delivery. Zero customer support. I mainly order from the cure.fit app and my last three orders have been proper shit. When I report an issue, they call back three days later. My opinion is skip this store altogether till they get their affairs in order. I can ignore an instance but not 4 consecutive instances."
Quantity is too less than expected.
orders paratha... received worst chapathi which I ever had...worst food
yummy and delicious
very less curry and more rice... with minimal spices and salt.. dint like it.
quantity is less
good food but too spicy üî•üî•
Wrong representation image of food while ordering used by restaurant. The image shows Laccha Paranthas and what you get is semi cooked plain tawa paranthas.
waste taste and it was very cool
too spicy
"quantity and quality, both were not upto the mark"
1. Taste is good. But rate is very high!
2. Newspaper advertisement yesterday was a CHEATING! Ad said Rs 129/ per plate whereas it costed me Rs 208/ per plate + taxes. So I shelled out Rs 150-200/ extra! Isn‚Äôt that Cheating or Fooling the customers?
Will I get Refund or compensation?
"eat fit one of the best food seller in fit food ,i ordered on 07 oct 2019 , i missing the food"
Just not the worth of money you pay for a meal. May sound and seem healthy but the quality and cost don't match up on any dish.
"Nicely managed stuff. Proper packaging, ticks all the boxes in terms of money value, qualiry and quantity"
"They have really nice menu. I've tried chicken curry, portion was medium size, it was very delicious and looked fresh. Will order more from this restaurant"
Please put excess oil into ur ass..... worst chilli paneer i ever come accross... shut ur restaurants down.
I have ordered dal makhani. the whole order was a mess. the box was not sealed. it had stains of dal all over it. and the quantity it was half of the half of box. I tried calling the restaurant.. guess what they don't care.. tried to contact delivery guy..guess what he doesn't pick up. This is purely going towards monopoly.. customer has no one to connect. All this has to change and i will start it. I will make sure noone of my contact order from you guys.
Eat fit food is usually always a delight and I trust that they send healthy food.
Unfortunately there was hair in one of the food items. I do understand things like this are never intentional. But it's very unpleasant when it happens. Request you to take better care when preparing/packaging your food.
masala idli package is half open and it's tastes avg...where as palak khichidi tastes horrible
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt picture of food but options here are healthy and satisfying.I tried their Rajma combo which was not spicy definitely healthy and best part is it‚Äôs affordable.. with Zomato offers the price comes down even lesser ..perfect option when you wish to eat clean and tasty food
Please ensure that the food is delivered properly
Dont call yourself eat.fit when you cant provide fresh food.
"the food was tasty , "
but I expected parathas as mentioned in the description instead of just roti ..!!
the chicken and the dal were all good.
Today I ordered the Vietnamese chicken curry with wok-tossed millet. It was by far the best thing I've eaten from the eat.fit menu. It's coconutty and creamy and the chicken was juicy and succulent. Worth every paisa. Thank you!
Mention salad in the order but didn't received
"The  noodles were sour and bitter and the portion of chicken is very less also to note the box was not sealed, I expect a fork for noodles not a spoon, Very bad the food was tasteless and horrible. Just threw it in bin. Don't reccomend to any one."
"Super nicely packed, big size 3 idlis, Sambar and chutney very tasty. Quantity of chutney can be little more.."
"Surprisingly well made with approximate nutritional figures. Convinient packaging. Good texture and consistency, good selection of fruits."
There is slight making difference in fruit pop oat meal for Both Gachibowli and kukatpally wings. In the ends it was good. A lot of other items need to be tried.
This is highly disappointing and unacceptable on the restaurant's part. They gave non veg order to a vegetarian. And on top of that Zomato doesn't respond to any customer complain. They simply put that automated response n close the chat. No call support. I was a big fan of ear fit. But not ordering from here ever again.
Too little quantity of chicken biryani for 400Rs. Toomany plastic things used for packing waste of money and not environment friendly. Taste is below average
"Healthy food + flavoursome + variety + packaging = Perfect meal! Ordered veg thali (paneer & Amritsari Dal) & Chicken Thali (Chicken & Dal) to office and as soon as I got it, I felt that it's going to be a great meal."
Really liked the way the thali was portioned and best part was the right quantity which is sufficient for 1 person easily...
The chili pickel and salad was icing on the cake üëç
Recommended!
"Perfect masala Omlette the way it should be and excellent combo of protiens, fibre, calories and carbs. Superb and hygenic packing.Keep up the same service and taste.!!"
Love everything I‚Äôve ordered from eat fit specially desserts üòç
"The order was unsealed when i received it eventhough it shows 100% safely sealed. Taste was just alright, not great. Delivery was on time, but expected it to be sealed. Cant have a food order unsealed."
The worst service no one from the restaurant bothered to call me to say my order could not be fulfilled since banana walnut cake was not available owners dont have any decency please be careful when ordering from here i was kept waiting in the lurch for half an hour i called both the numbers no one picked up my call manner less people. I will never order from here again disgusting this restaurant sucks !
They added colors on Onion..not at all eat fit..very bad ..I thought its quality one ..but not ............................
excellent food and delivery was also good.  The chutney which was provided was superb. Also paneer curry had lot of paneer as compared to other restaurants. First time in life it happened that my chapati got over while paneer pieces were still left in bowl.
"#Missing items, the description says that we get some salad and a superfood of the day along with the Non veg thali , all i got was Rotis and Chicken .... Kindly look into this ... Others , don't be mislead by this food company ..."
I ordered oatmeal box i got ants in it...eat fit is the name doesn't fit actually .food is completely bad..very bad..
How can
"i ordered veg biryani with dates pudding,and it was yummmilicious,eat fit never dissapoints,i can definately take gurantee of veg food that itsss amazinggg."
much love.
"I‚Äôve only order from here - So, excellent packaging, great quality tasty and healthy food. Their juices and oatmeal bowls are mind-blowing. I love ordering from here."
"Ordered Pav Bhaji, did not get any salad, as mentioned in the description. Also, the food was not packed in the temper proof packing. No response on call."
I was supposed to get a temper proof packaging but all I got was a box.
Food is very tasty and delicious
Packing is good
This food is healthy
The anti oxident kick drink is very healthy drink
Every one take the healthy food
Good food. Appropriate quantity. Calorie specifications provided. Budget friendly.
"Awesome taste, packing super with neatly , but price high and quantity low not sufficient for eater person. Finally Go for taste not for quantity"
"ordered Butterless Chicken & Veg Pulao a few days back.the qality , the quantity, the taste was just so amazing."
"the checkien pieces so properly cooked, gravy was so tasty, not spicy yet delicioucs."
Just loved this item.
would repeat again.
"Ordered 1 veg & 1 non veg thali. Food was below average. On top of it, salad as shows as an item was not there. They just put in a lemon, not sure for wat. Very poor taste & experience"
"Ordered Chilly Paneer with hakka noodles,"
The dish was cold and it felt as if it was not freshly cooked.
"The taste was okayish, however it could have been far better if the dish was served hot."
Previously ordered Rajma and vegetable pulao which also came as a cold box. It did not taste good at all.
Cancelled my order after 40 mins without any explanation. They had clearly accepted the order. Zomato executive called the case.
Cancelled my order after 1 hour. I have been waiting for it but they cancelled when other options weren‚Äôt also available.
"I had ordered food from here. They delivered stale food which might have been cooked 4-5 hours back. Did not expect this from eat fit and Zomato does not even replace the item, they just give refund"

Eat.fit is a life saver! Every item is healthy without compromising on taste. The prices are very reasonable.
It has a good choice of items to choose from. Tofu Paneer wrap is my personal favourite!
While my visit on Hyderabad I ordered there Chicken Thali.
This Thali is sufficient for 1 person .
The packaging was good üëçüëç No spills.
‚ô¶Ô∏èComing to Thali.
1 Box of Salad
Chicken Curry
Chapattis
Chilli
Pickle
Daal Makhni
‚ô¶Ô∏èComing to Taste
The chicken curry was full of flavours bit Tangy & spicy.Huge chunks of chicken in the gravy to satisfy your buds. A must try dish üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Wheat flour chapattis which I was craving for .Properly cooked üëçüëç
Not to miss the amazing daal Makhni which was equally full of flavours.üëçüëç
"Overall a absolutely tasty ,lipsmacking and that too fully loaded protein Thali."
I wish they have branch in Mumbai too.I would love...read more
Ordered weight watch: veg falafal salad. Taste was awesome. Quantity and quality was upto the mark. Moreover less oil and less fried food is the best part of ordering from eat fit.
I have ordered for a thali and a nutty date pudding . Pudding was amazing but the Thali was bad ! Paneer curry tasted like paneer sauted in tomato sauce and venigere ( very bland) and the quality was also not up to the mark . Dal was very very bad too ..
Very dissapointed about thali .
The food is packed in a plastic tray with grooves closed with a plastic lid and wrapped in a sealed plastic cover . This created lottof plastic waste . Will be great if such an exciting startup thinks about plastic waste and also increase the food quality .
We ordered 2 breakfast mentioning cheese mushroom omelette and bread omelette with roast potato wedges. In details it mentions tons of appealing descriptions like exotic herbs and bla bla. Bread is 2 tiny pieces of hard toast( check the pic) and potato wedges are 2 soggy pieces. Mushroom omelette is horrible. I wouldn't give a single star... Dissapointing
"Today I ordered lunch in eat.fit. Food is sooo tasty, felt like home food. Packing is amazing. Impressed with the quality and quantity.  Will order more and more. :)"
"Beautiful packing, great quality food, tastes like home. Would love to see the quantity increase though :p . Nonetheless, eat fit never leaves a place to complain."
I ordered Bombay Toast Sandwich. Flavor was bland with mashed potato and beet root stuffing in a brown bread not toasted properly (it was just grilled) with an absolute badly tasting mint dip.
Maybe their fitness freak food making gives this bland flavor.
Packaging was good with informative facts of food served.
"in Today's  Scenario it is quite difficult to maintain yourself , either it is in terms of Lifestyle or in terms of Food."
"Recently i Tried the menu of Eat.Fit which is Subsidiary of Cult Fitness , "
"I ordered A Combo Meal which Includes : 3 Parantha , Daal Makhani, Paneer Masala which has Complimentary Salad, Side of Pickled onions , Green Chilies  And 200ML Nimbu Shikanji"
Parantha's was 100% Whole Wheat
Daal was Sweetened with Honey
food was good but it turns down when i found a rotten lemon in the food and i heartly belive that you should care about the food quality when you are feeding someone
The quality of the food was grate but added gluten is the only problem I have please introduce gluten free foods to the menu I can recomend but check for gluten
"I ordered a meal with dal and paneer, 2 rotis and sweet dish. The taste was normal. If you want to have healthy it is a good option. Along with it I had anti oxidant drink. It will rejuvenate you."
"Sometimes it's tough to choose between healthy eating and taste, but this one has both. We yes, having our favorite biryani with a healthy twist and not compromising on taste, or that oats bowl when we are too lazy to cook. Their Chicken chettinad and tawa paratha meal is my favorite of all. The packing was good enough and comes with zomato secured packing. Do try out their kheema wrap for the evening snack you crave for. Overall the price is on the higher side for the quantity they provide but with 40% off on zomato it's definitely worth a try."
"Food has been really amazing,I never excepted healthy food to be this tasty and delicious and sweet,that had been given tasted awesome,food...üòçüòçüòç,but the quantity of the food was little"
"If you are looking for healthy, pocket friendly and filling meals, then look no further."
I was down with food poisoning and eat.fit's food nursed me back to health.
They have the best packaging and the food is so nutritious. Really great.
Thank you very much for your tasty and healthy food. Thank you for fixing me with your food. I am forever grateful to you.
I am a huge fan of eat fit. But this time the food spilled allover and the package got damaged. Wish they could have taken much care about this. I tried reaching the team but no response. Otherwise their food tastes really good and is healthy.
Less quantity..
"Good food. However the delivery is not always delivered in safe sealed packaging. Also, super food is not being delivered along with the food consistently"
Worst food by eatflit... Even chicken / roti was too bad. Taste less food from the eat.fit.
I request you to not to deliver these kind of food next time for anyone.
"Even from now onwards, i don't want to order any food from eat.fit"
Again! It's worst enough to eat.
Quantity of Vegetable pulov is half of box and not sufficient even for a single person...Food is not properly packed and sealed at all. I never order again from eat.fit....Not at all a fit
The sub was too small. I was expecting it to be a lot bigger as it said super sub. It was not filling. Overpriced too. Taste was good. Packaging was good too.
"Hi,"
"I am extremely unsatisfied and angry, of the food quality eat fit provide. As per the name it does not provide the good quality, After having the food my wife is continously vomiting, and the quantity is so less compare to the price. ü•∫üòïüòïüòïüòï"
The food out is pocket friendly and taste wise also its decent enough. Would only recommend if they can increase the salad quantity in the fit thali. Food has to be moderate spice as everyone does not have high spice tolerance.
"Pleasantly surprised with sealed packing. Great food, good taste, not overtly spicy. Value for money. Enough for one person, quantity not less either."
"The food was really good. And most importantly very well packed. Hygiene factor is superb üëç. I placed an order for Fit Thali & Masala egg Cury with vegetable Pulao, they were good in taste and as well as quantity."
GOOD GOING üëç
"Please do not do this with anyone else. Ordered chilli Paneer Hakka noodles, but received chilli chicken noodles. Really disappointed, not good"
Got the lucknowi veg biryani ordered.and it was yum.therw were many vegetables and was topped with paneer ..raita and another curry was given which tasted a little like sambar.
Suffiy for 1.and also the cutlery was eco friendly.
I ordered Idli lately and it was really hard and not eatable. Very bad experience. You can clearly understand in the pic as well. Theres no point of ordering from eatfit of it would be so bad.
The food taste is deteriorating by the day.
"Good food and hygiene. The quantity is very less. Very thin paper like rotis. The variety on the menu is also quite less. Overall if you have less hunger and want to eat a comparatively healthy food, you can order from here. I don‚Äôt trust other Hyderabad restaurants specially when it comes to north indian food. This restaurant is better than many in the market."
We tried -
Gobhi methi paratha - 1/5
Shikanji was good.
"Paratha had dust in it, and I will flag this place as unhygienic, even though they pretend to sell healthy food."
Food was good but it could really have been better. It's a great initiative by eat.fit to serve proper balanced diet. Food was delivered in expected time.
Very disappointed..as the name say eat.fit I expected the meal to be healthy ..roti was half cooked not healthy to eat.. had to remove uncooked corners..couldn‚Äôt differentiate between your paranthas and rotis..curry‚Äôs also not up to the mark..you should improve your quality of food or either change your chef..
The food served is amazing and of course with the count of calories makes it even more healthy. The number of options available in veg and non veg makes it worthwhile too. I am only disappointed with the delivery which has now stopped at Gowlidoddy. Few days back you were serving to this location and now it shows unserviceable. There are people who look forward to your food and would appreciate it if you could start your services to this area again at the earliest.
I have received sealed open drinks when I try to ask executive with out response he has left on bike.again Zomato has started cheating customer
"Tawa paratha which i call chapathi, being a South Indian, at home was wonderful. Not too hard, not too soft. Chicken Chettinad could have been better. Too much of water i guess but still tasted pretty good. However after ordering twice or thrice more i might even go for subscription. I like the packaging they used for deliveries. It felt so hygienic. Keep up the good work."
Yes restaurant name says eat fit.... is it really delivering fit food?? Delivering hot hot food in a plastic bowl? Is that what you call healthy fit food??
Food tasted & review:
"1. Chilli tofu hakka noodles - tasted good and healthy obviously, what else you need."
"2. Healthy brownie - it tasted like any other brownies which means they did a good job to not compromise on taste in the effort to make it healthy, kudos."
Overall Rating:
Taste - 5/5
Cost - 4/5
Overall - 4.5/5
PS: we should get more healthy restaurants like these with affordable prices.
"This is my first North Indian meal in Hyderabad and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint me at all, i ordered their fit thali including 3 thin rotis, salad, paneer and dal makhni everything made in low skimmed milk. Also I had their veg pulao and egg curry. Thali was really delicious and suitable for one person. While the egg curry tasted a little like sambhar. In totality the delivery was quick and food was nicely packed."
I would surely order again !
The food is less oily and spicy than other joints. One good thing they practice is giving the calorie count on the food packaging. But the portion sizes are not the prices. The taste of the food is also very subdued. You can order from here once in a while but the food isn't to die for.
"Great food, the quality was really nice. Taste wise the items were good too. They were all fresh and liked the packing as well. Appreciate the presentation of nutritional information on the cover."
Can you guys please extend the delivery service to Princess Esra & Owaisi hospital. Being a doctor it's really difficult to find fit meals in this area. Looking forward for your response.
"I have ordered food at 7:45pm and at 9:05pm I have received message saying your food has been delivered, but it was delivered to others, after checking the message I called Delivery boy and asked where is my food he says I just delivered, then I have asked Can you please come and checky order I'd and name in my smart phone, he failed to come and he made wait until 9:30pm."
Eat.fit is doing the best and I request/suggest do not trust Zomato they are fools they have cheated me.
I have been ordering on eat.fit since their inception. I enjoy their food and concept. I appreciate their pricing structure for their quality standards. But this 1* is only for this order (all other orders were 5*). I got an absolute raw piece of chicken in my lucknow chicken biryani (Not even 5% cooked). Please take care of these things. Very disappointing for your standards. (Zomato gave me a full refund)
Ordered rajma rice...taste was so so... Quantity was too less as per the cost... Not even sufficient for single person... Plastic boxes shouldn't be used for packaging if they are concerned with customer's health.
The quality of the biryani was very good. The best part was chicken piece. It was so soft.
Rice was basmati rice and well cooked and correct amount of flavours
It was yum.
Must try
This is a totally new concept for people who are concerned about what they eat .
"Overall food taste is good , tried the Lucknowi biryani but it was no where near to the authentic Lucknowi biryani ."
Might be because it has less masala seeing that this place makes sure you eat healthy.
"Third class service, ordered lunch at 11:30AM with order id -1483595108 on 11th June, and I didn't received any food though app says its been delivered."
"Checked at security register at my office, none has shown up."
Pathetic and no contact number available.
"Eat.fit, well you are providing healthy food and counting calories of the food we order which is really very good but the packing is not good. I felt the Zomato guy had some bite because I could see some food on his mouth and he was talking I could sense he has definitely had something from that box. Why don't you seal the food package properly so we would not have that kind of doubt.Hope you will take action and make your customer happy. Thanks!"
very sour.
Its awesome and healthy.. its hygenic and be healthy..its having fruits oats and sabjas including milk with dry fruits and no plastic spoons
"I order the gobi paratha breakfast combo from here usually. The curd that comes in it is very diluted compared to the same thing I order from the Jubilee Hills outlet,whose curd was very thick. Maybe its diluted in this outlet compared to the jubilee hills outlet."
"The dal was really watery, need a refund"
no superfood sent.
I mostly order the veg chef thali which has one dal curry salad paneer curry( generous amount of paneer which is quite soft and melt in mouth) and if u order for the first time u aslo get a free energy bar the thali is very filling and very healthy to eat and not to mention very tasty ...i also ordered the nutty dates pudding lemon chia cake and banan choco chip cake though the cake is tasty but i feel its little overpriced for its size.overall a healthy option to savour your sweeth tooth.
We ordered pista kheer delivery so late 1 hours 30 minutes..pista kheer taste very bad..I am not satisfied..can be improve food taste...really
"Yaak food. Never expect that i will fall sick aftrr eating food from here. They make roti in roti maker, hence not healthy. Even tasty wise its very synthetic. Not homely"
Ordered fit thali with masala chaanch combo for lunch. Must say it felt like ghar ka khana made with less oil. Paneer sabzi was awesome. It's legit value for money. Will try other offerings for sure.
"Worst place to order food, they take order but after 1hr they will cancel the order and zomato won't do a thing about it..just send money back..both side service is worst"
"Eat fit is one place from where I have order multiple times and I have had a great experience all together. My favorite things to order has been their Chicken Fit thali, Tofu Bhurji and lacha parantha box consisting of Sprouts, Fresh cut fruits alongside Paranthas, Bhurji and Gobi Methi paranthas with chutney."
"The packaging of their food has been a big positive for me. Apart from that, they also ensure that one gets specified calorie meal which is a great boost for people. One slight area of improvement can be their price range. Eat fit has been regarded as one of the premium segment food delivery setup since quite some time. I am sure that in coming days, Eat fit can look upto this...read more"
"The food was not good at all. The onion, pickled onion or whatever that was it was not even a quarter of the smallest onion, dal makhani was not even near the taste of the actual dal makhni, i don't know what it was, the paratha was also very saggy."
I wasted my money. I'm not ordering next time from you.
"I am rating it low as I ordered paratha and got roti. Although, roti was good but again I wanted to eat paratha . Please be more deligent in double checking such orders."
I had ordered gobi methi paratha.. it was ok. Not good. It was too oily. Not much taste. It tasted like it was a re-heated paratha. Not fresh.
Food was good but it was all leaking from the plate. And so quantity was very less as compared and i expected rice as well with the thali but it was missing
"Intially, yes,the food was really good they were maintaining quality standard of food very well,which is rare in Indian restaurant nowadays I don't see that happening these.Today I have found hair my fit thali,which shows how much hygienic they are ,apart from this so many times I have seen they miss on cutlery or few items. I mostly order fit thali so I know very well what it consist of not just one time so many time items are missing."
"Hyderabad's most worst and ugliest biryani i had yesterday from the restaurant Eat fit and this worst restaurant people not allowing zomato people quick to the destination delivery points, it has been 2hr late i have received from the biryani from Eat fit, just disguised about the biryani of the EATFIT Alaasss.. this is a Horrible biryani i had ate in Hyderabad"
Very good at quality guys..even packaging is extraordinary..but chicken curry is not good which came more liquid with less taste.so quality quantity wise thumsup..but have to improve taste.
Thank you so much for the excellent food.it tasted great. Price quality everything good. I ordered via zomato online app. Delivery package was also great.if there was a way if packaging more environment friendly that would be great
Order no - 1127326452
Ordered rajma rice and what I received cold and badly smelly rotten food. Completely disappointed.
And Zomato is not even helpful to resolve it.
"Last time I ordered the food(Tofu keema wrap, dal makhni and parathe) from here, I was delivered spoiled food. The wrap was literally smelling sour and parathe were like they have been prepared in the morning and sent to us for dinner. I always order from this restaurant and since it was the first time, I wanted to ignore this But, still putting out this review so that management can introspect and figure out if this was process fault, delivery fault or a manual one."
"Whenever you get the urge to eat hygienic food with less calories this the place to order from. It offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from Indian, Continental, Oriental and even Caribbean. The food is prepared in a way that it is healthy, but doesn‚Äôt compromise on taste. Also, the dishes are reasonably priced. My only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly."
I had ordered the weight watch veg and it was awesome.. Healthy and tasty as well. Food quality was really very good. I had ordered for the second time and this weight watch forced me to write a review.. I couldn't help myself.. Fantastic.. Keep it upp.. U have raised a bar.. Do the good work always :)
I received food with a live green insect in it. What food standards are being followed! This is not expected from a restaurant with an ‚Äòexcellent hygiene‚Äô title!
Food was open
I ordered dal makhani with paratha . The parathas were good so soft and tasty .Dal makhani was ok.It was tasting some different but it was good .üòä
Very delicious millet and chicken dish.
I feel so good ordering and eating from eat.fit bc I can see the nutritional value and no where else I have found this yet! I love that they give a mini free desert too - perfect sweet treat after a meal.
"Till now ordered chef's special veg thali, oat meal, parantha in super breakfast"
Pros
# Calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud
# ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed
"# taste, quality are great"
Now i felt few things can be improved
"# Delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. Also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well."
# Plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# Price and quantity ratio : I felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
"Eg: Oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs...read more"
"Great food. No oil, soft rotis, tasty gravy and juicy chicken. It's a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals."
We have multiple options to have food but thinking about healthier options - there are very few. I would like to appreciate all your effort to provide us an option to choose heathy and hygienic food. Great place to order healthy and tasty food.
very less quantity and food taste also not gud
"Ordered chef's veg special thali from this place and it was just awesome, 3 rotis, paneer curry( which had so many paneer) , salad, dal makhani, sweet, everything was equally good and tasty. Ordered for the first time from this place and with all the discounts I paid just 61 for the food and got 50 as cashback."
I totally loved it and would definitely order again
"Quality-6/5 I did feel I am eating homemade, healthy food"
Quantity-5/5
Value for money-6/5
Packaging- 5/5
Delivery- 6/5
It was a good experience ordering food from this place
"PS this experience is when i ordered from cult app, later on when I order using Zomato things were quite different like delivery was late, no sweet"
Ordered lunch from this place. The taste was good. Food wasn‚Äôt spicy or oily. packing was good and quantity was sufficient. I would prefer to order again.
The food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours.
Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!
Have u hv had this kind of feeling ? üòÉ
Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.
Suggestions:
Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.
Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!
I ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for Zomato to deliver. Zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but I am never going to order from this restaurant. Also the food was below average. I ordered Tofu Keema roll.
Ordered a Wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset. The quality of food seemed really bad that time. Although I tried reaching out to Zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eat.fit team will get back. Till date I haven't received any response from either Zomato or Eat.fit
Hey Guys!! I ordered Chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this wasn't a good experience at all...The only plus point can be given for good packaging. But packaging doesn't count as we pay for good food. The biryani didn't even taste like a biryani. It was more like fried rice with chicken dumped. üò£ Had a very bad experience...
If you want to eat something delicious without feeling guilty about eating unhealthy food then eat.fit is your go to place. Delicious tofu keema parantha having no extra spice's and perfect balance of flavors
For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat.fit which has 450Kcal (as mentioned).
"Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box. Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil. Chapatis were homely, soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad. A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier. Not sure if I would order this again, but could maybe try their salads."
Why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry. Unless the buyers are fools.
Terrible pricing and quantity for the money.
2 stars just for decent taste of curry.
All those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you can‚Äôt have sufficient food inside.
"Oh boy, will never try üôèüèªüôèüèª"
"Btw, the dish name is chefs special nonveg thali üòÇ"
Forgot to give spoon and tissues
Worst food ..... I would never order from this again... I ordered lucknowi biryani .... That turned out bullshittt.... It looked like timato chutney rice ....
"Eat healthy, eat.fit. Tried their nutty dates pudding and detox smoothie. Both were very good and it is good to have healthy food like these."
"We ordered 1 Luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees. The taste was okay. Strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani. But I haven't had Lucknow biryani before, so can't really judge how it exactly supposed to taste."
Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.
"Dal tadka awesome rajma chawal so-so, too garlicky"
"Ordered the breakfast combo from zomato. The taste was good and simple. Feels just like home made food and healthy too. The breakfast combo had a bread/bun, omelette, grilled tomato and side(curry kinda ) for the bun."
I ordered from this place from Zomato. The amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant. I ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes. The juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml. The potato flakes nothing more than normal Haldiram mixture. I am definitely not ordering next time.
A 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
Well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks.
"So i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their Chicken Keem Paratha Wrap. Its was oily and tasted ok, not bad at all. It tasted just  like a regular keema wrap bus."
"Yes it came with sugar/ honey coated peanuts and some green chutney, am not sure how it makes up the diet fit. But yes, a nice concept though!"
"Great, hygienic and health food. Good packing."
"All the ingredients look and taste fresh. More importantly, you get what you see."
I hope they maintain the veg non veg segregation.
A little expensive.
Food quality and quantity is not up to mark. A family pack of chicken biriyani comes with 430 RS and it contains only 2 pretty small pieces and rice relatively very less. No raita or salan given. Not at all worth for money.
"Quality is also not very good, didn't feel anything great about , worst place to order food. Sorry however that's the reality.. Thanks."
"I found a small wooden stick in the tofu keema wrap I ordered from eat.fit. Apparently, not so hygenic and healthy as they claim themselves to be!"
"An easy choice everyday among so many others for dinner. Not only is the food tasty, hygienic and healthy, their services, discounts and the entire cure fit package is just amazing and a well deserved hype success"
I had ordered veg pulav and egg masala bowl no egg and no taste pulav have no vegetables even restaurant took 1 hour to give it to the delivery boy this is ridiculous ü§¨ü§¨
"Ordered fruit pop oatmeal bowl before as well and again it's very delicious. I see that this time different type of oats(wheat based) are used and that the amount of oats is lesser compared to amount of fruits or otherwise the fruit content is higher. Like the combination of oats, sabza seeds and milk & the usage of uncommonly used fruits like pear, cranberries besides apple, dates, pomegranate."
"Have ordered from here multiple times but today the food wasn't up to standards. Ordered 'Chef's Special Combo for 2'. The salad and raita smelled bad. Weren't fresh. Had to throw them away. You folks have made a name, stick to its standards."
"Had ordered veg pulao & rajma, it didn't seem fresh .. however I consumed it & couldn't sleep whole night because of vommiting & loose motion."
Will never order food from eat.fit again.
"Super delicious nutty dates pudding. Simple dish made with wheat, milk, natural sweetener jaggery(gud). It was topped with almonds, dates, kishmish. There was no cashew nuts as specified in menu. Else would've rated 5."
"Pomegranate protect was simply amazing. One can feel raw pomegranate, coconut juice. Satisfied with quantity for both items(bought on zomato offer)"
"Fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing. Surprisingly it's not what typical oatmeal bowls are. Oats, soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear, apple, pomegranate, dates and mint leaves. Superb taste enough for a person."
All eatfit drinks/juices are amazing and so was Guava glow. Could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon. The pepper was unidentifiable in juice.
Less quantity
"Really healthy and tasty food. Quantity is a bit at the lower end for the given price, hence expensive."
Would recommend dal chawal. The sweet they as complimentary are really good. Should try to reduce plastic use in packaging as they are heavy on it due to marketing stunts
quantity too less for a meal
Ordered chicken thali for two from here. Loved the effort they put in packaging and attaching printed labels of your name to the food.
"A wholesome meal for two, it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each, daal, chicken gravy, raita, salad, pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugar."
A healthy alternative to oustide food if you're working out . Enjoyed the complimentary date tea cake as well.
not valued for money
"I strongly recommend this place for the folks who are conscious about calories. I would suggest eat.fit to look after the quantity,because I think it's very little with this price tag. Apart from this everything is extraordinary like packing ,presentation,quality etc...All the best eat.fit."
"I have ordered kachori & chana chaat for home delivery from zomato. I was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eat.fit ( previously ordered food quality being good). As soon as I opened the box bad smell was coming, then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachori's. The chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachori's were also smelling bad. I had to throw away everything. I don't think I can order again with trust on their food quality."
Dates tea cake was good. I was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates. It was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthier.
"Topped with chia seeds, the Lemon tea cake was surprising as I could feel cinnamon. It was slightly oily. At first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cake."
"These cakes are Wheat based just as described which is a good thing.Though the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes, I wish it could've been more just as shown in cult fit website."
Health consciously designed menu and quality food. Packing is also very nice.
"Keep up the good work.  Provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner."
"Eat.fit is is the next level service witch can offer you the basic and simple food with all required proteins, calories and energy. And their packing is awesome üëè"
"Totally love the food. The food tastes great, isn't fried, oily or too spicy. Just the way I like it. Has helped me check my weight also. Thank you. What would I have done for my everyday lunch without you? ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è"
I ordered tofu keema paratha and it was really good with the right measurable quantity of healthy and delicious food. The food was perfectly packed.
chicken was good..mix veg is very sweet..and small roties..
eat.fit you beauty üòç
"If there's one place where you can order and nothing goes wrong, it has to be eat.fit outlets."
I have ordered tofu burji and lacha paratha for breakfast this morning. There was also yummy tomato chutney apart from burji.
"If you ever want to indulge and order a meal that is guilt free, tasty and with great packing it has to be this place."
"eat.fit provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner."
"I never, ever, ever knew healthy food can be so tasty."
Order now!!!!!
Ordered this delicious healthy dish! ‚ù§ massaman veg curry and thai rice bowl... Loved it. Curry is so smooth and contains everything as described in the eat.fit. menu.
"Everybody is talking about Eat Fit these days! I was curious to know what's causing so much buzz? So, I ordered Chef's Special Veg Thali.It contained 3 wheat flour rotis, paneer ki sabzi, daal makhni, salad, pickle, and a healthy dessert!"
I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.
Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.
"But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot."
"Overall, if you are...read more"
very poor food and my items were missing
I had ordered chilly chicken Hakka noodles. It taste good. Chicken pieces are well seasoned and juicy. Iam impressed with the presentation. Taste would have much better. It not taste like real Chinese cuisine. But I recommend to try atleast once
Healthy food calls for eat.fit.. good packing and decent food.. price is a bit on the higher side
Rotis could have been better. Will definitely order more from here..
"Can you explain, how spicy food is healthy? In addition to this, the chapatis were super dry and both vegetables were tasteless. Not worth the wait and money of course."
The food was amazingly delicious. I ordered the food online and the packing and delivery service was quite impressive. they even sent a complimentary cake which was delicious. the best part about this app is you can order delicious food without thinking about health because everything is nutritious.
I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli. I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 
1) They do not use any processed ingredients 
2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 
3) They use less amount of oil...read more
Frankly speaking this is my 5th order and many more to come.
Hygeine-5/5
Taste-5/5
Quality-5/5
Very impressed with the out of box concept of a superfood served with all items. Keep it up!!
Overpriced crap on the name of healthy food. The food industry has become a dark business nowadays looting customers on the name of healthy food. Quantity is too less at the price they sell.
"I have been wanting to have food from this place since a while as it had a good rating and reviews as well and the main thing here is ""healthy food"" unlike the other restaurants were we wouldn't even know how many calories we are consuming and I was thrilled to order food from this place. So I ordered Vegetable Pulao (BrownRice) and egg white masala curry and let me tell you it tasted yum and the packing was excellent. Damn I guess I'm gonna be quite regular in ordering food from here now!!"
Excellent food. Everytime I order Just love the way they present their food and the freshness nd nutrition it has. Perfect food place for fitness freaksss. Keep up the same honest work you give!!
Kudos!!
"You need to improve your packing. Had ordered veg Thai green curry with rice. By the time it was delivered to me, curry had splashed all over the container , even leaking from package. Zomato delivery person said it leaked while getting it. Had second thoughts abt whether to consume it or not."
"It‚Äôs really difficult to get tasty healthy food. Eat.fit is kinda solving this problem. Food quantity is good, display of nutritional facts made me happy. I know what I am eating and can plan my day if following a diet."
"Ordered Chicken Peanut Curry & Wok-Tossed Millet Bowl. Gravy tasted good with mix of veggies. Quality of chicken in the gravy is less than normal portion. Millers were kinda dry,overall good experience for me."
Great place to order decent food. Have ordered dinner from them on multiple occasions. The taste is definitely great - especially their exotic chicken dishes. The indian menu is also very satisfying. Have developed a deep liking for their date pudding. It's great comfort food. The food is not oily and doesn't leave you feeling bloated.
"The berry blast smoothie tasted very good. Could actually feel the taste of papaya, watermelon, blueberries,etc and can even make them out. The quantity was a big disapointment. The bottle was thin as well. The smoothie was finished in few gulps."
Taste is not good and also not freshly prepared. It seems food was cooked at afternoon and delivered during evening for dinner. Also not spicy.
"Highly recommend this place. The entire menu is so captivating and pleasing at the same time with a thought left in your mind that ""yay don't worry you are eating healthy"". And the food literally looks healthy no excess oil no hints of butter etc it's simply delicious and perfect. I tried Dal Makhni, Paneer Curry, Masala Chaach and Tofu Keema Wrap all were fantastic in order of my mention .ü§ü"
"I ordered Thai chicken rice. First of all, it is on the expensive side. Second, the quantity wasn't good, third it was spicy. Seems like they are spending more on fancy packaging than the actual food."
not tasty
I've ordered fruit pop oat meal bowl and it was delicious and it contains green apple and basil seeds and pomogranate and banana and also dates .its the most healthiest diet that one could ever have in an affordable price.it tastes delicious and oats taste good .if you're on diet and want to choose a perfect oat meal this is the best one that you've ever asked for .keep it up guys .
I have ordered for one item oat meal and received another item ghar rasma veg pulao. Which is not satisfactory and wastage of food and money.
It said thali but not adequate quantity
"An awsumm place where u can order variety of healthy food .Strongly recommended to try everything on the menu as it is healthy, fresh and hygienic everytime its ordered. U dont have to worry about the calories.Every dish comes properly labelled with it's nutritional value, so you know what you're having."
"Ordered the paneer-dal combo for 2 people. It comes well packed in a big box. The quantity of the food is great! 3 chapatis for a person, raita, dal makhni, paneer, salad, pickle and super food supplement. We also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake. So in terms of quantity a 5/5. Coming to the taste - The paneer was soft, the curry was well cooked and was tasty. Dal was decent, probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind, wasnt high on spices or oil. The curd was fresh and good in taste as well! Loved the over all parcel!"
"Dear eat.fit , what on Earth charging you 180/- ? For this 3 rotis, 2 spoons of veg curry, enough dal and little salad with spoon of raita"
I am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness.
3 star is for taste and quality. But quantity doesn't even meet expectations.
Very poor
I ordered from eat.fit and sorry to say the food was at all not good. Both taste and quantity were below my expectations.
The food I ordered was Masala egg curry with Vegetable Pulao with Order Id: 1676056120
Zomato delivery guy when delivered I realized that curry was spilling from the box. When enquired he said this is packaging problem.
After Zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eat.fit seems to be not bothered. 
After opening the box the food was just half a bowl. Rice taste seems to be of very low quality. Bad service from eat.it and from Zomato.
My first and last order from eat.fit. Already uninstalled Zomato . Overall very unpleasant experience.
Quality of food and packing is good.. Quantity is less in the bowl.. My advice would be to increase the quantity of dish as little quantity won't be sufficient for an individual.
"Great food came up with neatly packed and the delivery person was handled the package with care and delivered on time, thanks to Zomato to be a partner with this kind of great restaurant around us. Eat.fit is unbelievable and marvellous food making and packing"
This restaurant has no mention of contact details on their web page
And after a long hard work I found one contact through zomato customer service .....which was also WRONG
This shows the professionalism and attitude of this restaurant
They have three to four branches in hyderbad but none of them have provided any contact number
Moreover zomato also registers as adds restaurants without taking proper details from them
Poor show
I would give a half star
Horrible experience with eat.fit
Ambience:NA
Service: NA
Food: very tasty and healthy. Dry fruit laddu is best part of athletic meal.
"Matar patti with tomato curry is very tasty, soft, rich flavour of tomatoes enhanced the tast even more."
Dal makhani with parata
Food &quality: 3/5
"Dal makhani is chatpat no other flavour. Parata were pure wheat made but they were hard when I received. Sweet was not good at all but mix of sounf, sesame...."
Overall it was ok.
Dal Makhani with tawa roti
Packaging: Very good as always
This time I received hot roti and tasty dal makhani.
Small sweet box have peanut chikki.
Overall it's a good place to order food.
"I had lachha paratha and chettinad chkn. Lachha paratha was cold and was very hard to chew. For the amount you guys are charging, I expected a better experience."
Eat fit - name itself suggest healthy food..
I have ordered it from Zomato and the delivery was quick..
I ordered veg paneer keema paratha and lucknowi biryani.. Packaging was good and food was hot..
paratha was delicious it was flooded with lots of paneer and finely chopped veggies..it's healthy and tasty too..
Loved their lucknowi biryani too.. veggies were coated with delicious spices..and that aroma was Soo good..They served raita and salan which was tasty too..
Follow me on Instagram on veganyums_ for more food fun and pics..
"Eat. Fit surprised me the way they packed the food is really nice. Nice parota with good curry, I recommend order from eat.fit is worthfull....."
"I have been a fan of eat.fit for a while.Today I ordered roti with bhuna mix veg curry and hing wali chana .The taste was good but the mix veg curry was too spicy, that too for someone like me who eats medium spicy food.I don't think spicy food can in any way qualify as healthy.Humble request:please keep up the authenticity of your brand.There are way too many south Indian restaurants already serving super spicy food."
I ordered Punjabi Dal Tadka and Veg Pulao. But the taste of Pulao is below average. It didn't even taste like Pulao. The zeera that was given along with the order was good.
Not value for money. Original cost needs to cut down. I'd not order this if there were no discount from Zomato.
Dry and not good test Lucknow biryani.
Ordered chefs special thali from eat.fit and it has been served chilled. What is the use of ordering if i have to heat that up again. Zomato support is also not taking the responsibility and I recommend not to have this restaurant in your list
"Tasty,healthy, less spicy and appropriate quantity. Chef‚Äôs special thali‚Äôs are really nice. Well packaged along with complete information about the calories for health conscious people."
Food quality is good but packing needs to be improved. Curd got spilled all over parathas.
"I first had eat fit when they launched in Bangalore year and half ago, great portions and fantastic ingredients with nutritioninfo. Coming to my morning breakfast today, tofu scramble with laccha and gobi paratha is definitely worth a mention. Churney n curd on paratha was watered down and gobi paratha lacked gobi. Definitely not worth the price and shouldnt be called gobi paratha. Want to have good paratha in area , little unhealthy , but great on stuffing and taste, try 13 dhabha!"
Coming to tofu scramble it was decent nothing i will crave for. some tomato gravy on side? Confused me!
"Overall, Given the portion size, it ought to be healthy; less food is less calorie."
I am puzzled by...read more
"Wide variety of choices with a daily change of menu. Have been very satisfied with all the dishes I had to date like Vietnamese rice bowl, veg kheema paratha, Thai green curry. Packing is very good too. No oil food is a big plus."
The service of this restraunt is very poor and on good thing is that THEY DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT. To add to the pain the food lacks tastes as well.
"My order was delayed by one and half hour, and when i tried to reach restraunt, they arogantly refused to even talk."
I had to order from some other restaurant after having two bites as the taste was really a disaster.
I don't recommend this to anyone.
#poortaste # worstservice.
"Just tried one of their juice option- *Pomegranate Protect*, which was good, plain and simple 200 ml of Cold pressed Pomegranate juice mixed with Blueberry and,"
The *Detox Smoothie* which was really tasty. Would have been perfect if the size was bigger for the price.
"I ordered a chicken kheema Parantha, the taste was fine. But I have issue with ratio of carbs, protein, fats and fibre they claim to give, which does not seem to be accurate according to the served food. A muscle builder may rely on the brand for the ratio to perfect for him/her, as it claims, but rather actually gains."
"Finally a good and healthy food source when I cannot find time to cook .Good bye to all masala and overly spicy items from others . Ordered breakfast , lunch and dinner . All are excellent-egg burji paratha, rajma , veg thali üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
I have started ordering from eat.fit for lunch in office and it makes my day.
"I'm a freeletics athlete, and crave for clean and tasty food. Don't believe my words, just order any random dish and try. BTW my usual lunch is either Laccha Paratha and Dal Makhani or Chef's Special Veg Thali."
The healthiest food you can order in town.
"Decent and healthy food but too costly and quantity of chicken is really less, healthy lovers can try"
Had exclusive with Zomato and ordered there
A hungry tummy and a healthy diet!
"Eat.Fit to the rescue- I had been hearing the name way too often, finally decided to try it one day."
"What a surprise package! Excellent packaging, not a single drop of food spilt over and cutlery was provided along with the food. Calorie intakes were mentioned- something new and interesting üôÇ food was delivered hot and quick!"
"I had ordered the Chef Special Veg Thali. It had dal, Paneer and 3 rotis. Salad and superfood of the day. Superfood was a tiny bit of jaggery and peanuts. Paneer was yum, dal was good too."

My only concern is the quantity- quite...read more
"I ordered veg thali for dinner, sabji and daal was good but rotis we're not fresh. I felt like they were leftovers from lunch or yesterday's dinner. Disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è."
Food received is not good. It seem like yesterday s uncooked food served to me. Not value for money. I thrown it dust bin. Pls improve ur quality on food but not on cutlery and packing
"I would say it was Eat.UNFIT, ordered egg curry combo with lacha paratha and the parathas were very hard. And they were not smelling fresh. Seemed like frozen lacha parathas. Couldn‚Äôt eat it also. Egg curry was good though"
Highly disappointed!
"Ordered online, Chef's special veg thali, and quite liked it. Taste and packing were good, no two things mixed on the way to my home. I really liked the wooden fork n spoon that were given rather than plastic ones. All was good, just the dessert was missing!"
"Eat.fit has demonstrated that healthy food can also be tasty. I am a cult.fit member and tried out eat.fit post my workout. I had their salad which tasted too good to be even called a salad! For lunch, I opted for dal sabzi roti option and though the dal was just average, the rotis were cooked to perfection. I followed these up with smoothies. I will definitely give these healthy foods a try once again."
"By seeing the name you would think so good food and all, but it didn't go at all like that. We ordered for the whole team for 10 members and the food packing was so worst that we didn't feel like eating at all. Somehow we tried and it was so bad. Recommend not to eat again."
quantity for price too low
A Hungry soul ordering dinner!!
I had a pan Asian chicken platter. What I loved the most was the rice being replaced by quinoa.
The chicken pieces were cooked in coconut oil. I loved the taste for a change.
I ordered a green Smoothie as well.
Would love to order again.
I am a cult.fit member
I have ordered Chef Special Veg thali from here
The way they packed it and the taste was fantastic
In the CHEF SPECIAL VEG THALI
It had Paneer curry and Dal makhani and 3 Roti‚Äôs as well and the salad and the other things were given in a small and cute boxes
I also received a complimentary Nutty Pudding which was amazing
The delivery was fast and neatly packed
The cutlery was also given.
The paneer curry was too good in taste
The dal was not upto the mark.!
On the food there was a slip attached which had like how many calories the fat the protein and all other things

Would highly recommend this..!

I ordered Dal makhani with Parathas from eat fit today. Dal makhani was too watery and parathas were too tight. Disappointed with today‚Äôs order.
Wanted to eat something healthy and this was the only thing which came to mind as I've been seeing too many ads and posters. Not bad. The quantity and quality was more than what I thought it would be. Good source of protein from this masala egg curry and veg pulao. Looking forward to order different items to try out.
Hungry and want to eat healthy with a good source of protien - Tofu Keema wrap.
A perfect source of protein and fibre with a blend of tasty Indian flavours. I was amazed the way Tofu was cooked with the right combination of vegetables.
This dish has become my all time favorite.
"Today's order i am not at all happy and hence 2/5, Initially Eat.Fit Signature Fruit Bowl for example very impressive and was precise in accordingly but over the period of time bowl comes half empty with only 2 raisins while compared to 15 with the previous order., and now coming to the veg thali, I would rate it 3/5. Order delivery time doesn't match with actuals and always delay waiting for 1.2 - 1.7 hrs."
"I have ordered chicken salad, which was tasteless and cold. Also, the lettuce used in salad was not fresh. This is my first and last order from eat.fit."
"Idea is good , but food is not up to mark of price given."
Idea of saving paper nd avoiding covers is nice.
That's it that's it that's it that's
"Awesome taste,quality and high standard of hygeine maintained..keep of the good work.Suggestion of creating more setup like near by Madhapur.."
Pathetic food. Did not expected this poor quality from eat.fit. I ordered dal makhani and lacha paratha. The parantha‚Äôs were stale and there was no salt in dal makhani. The foil paper used to wrap the parantha‚Äôs looked like it has been used several times before. There were two foil papers and the outside one was wet.
I have placed order once and food was cold and didn't seem like prepared freshly.
"Also, I have felt that quantity provided was not worth the price(at least by going with the taste and freshness)"
"Very dissatisfied with the service. Ordered through zomato at 8:44 pm , the delivery guy has been waiting for more than 1 hour but still no updated..not recommended for online food."
The food tastes good. It is good on the nutrition part too. Price is one downside. The delivery quality is generally bad. Raita was leaking out of the plastic box once. And once there was only chicken pieces and all the curry had leaked out already. You guys can do with some better packaging.
I have ordered Fruit Pop Oatmeal Bowl . The food tasted really too good . You people made healthy food into a tasty food .. Thanks To Eat.fit...
"Haven't been to this place but often keep ordering the food, the packing is damn good and very neat. They do mention the calaries in the food served. Very tiny portions of salads and dessert depending on the menu you choose. Taste is also too good. But the everything is so expensive :)"
eat.fit made a lot of noise and marked it's presence through aggressive marketing. Even I was excited to see such inviting healthy food pics. Now when I have been trying their food for a couple of months. I feel it's a hit and miss and more miss than hit. The Indian meal menu that is being served is tasteless. So the motive healthy and tasty is nowhere even close to the food being served. But yes I love the puddings and salads from here.
worst of worst
I have ordered a nutty date pudding and a sindhi chicken thali.
I would rate the pudding as 3.5/5 because the taste was very average but the good thing was the sugar level was very less and plenty of nuts were there.
"Now coming to the thali,I would rate it 4/5. The rotis were very soft,the veg curry was well cooked and tasty,the pickel was less oily, along with dahi and vegetable salad. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken which tasted very average and it would have been good if the balance between coriander and spices would be proportionate."
Another thing I must mention is that there packaging is too good with ground nuts mixed with jaggery came in a small container as the super...read more
Nice and Hygienic Meal.
It's Healthy so you can compromise with the taste.
I really appreciate the packing!
I ordered Chicken Chettinad and Laccha Parantha Meal.
"This is one of the best options when u want to have tasty yet healthy food.I ordered chicken salad and chicken thali.Loved both of them.The salad was very filling and delicious.Very new taste and style of cooking.The price although is a little on the higher side, the packaging, food quality, variety, taste and everything else is top notch.The quantity can be increased a little to maintain balance with the pricing.Neway I am fan of this brand and will certainly order again :)."
Would recommend it to everyone. Awesome
"Hi,"
"Food is okay, I felt higene should be improved. Taste is also normal nothing special. Even it's not like home food.it was spicy also which"
First of the all there was great need of some healthy food joint options in the town and this place serves the purpose well. Menu is quite versatile offering fancy as well homely meal options. 
I have ordered egg curry with veg brown rice pulao. Food was tasty and served in good quantity. 
Good initiative for people looking for healthy homely option.
"I ordered Chef's Special veg thali. First is Food packing is outstanding which they charge a very small amount but very much significant because that creates the first impression! Secondly the taste is very good, not lip smacking which is because they made it very well without using any oils and junk, adding carrot and keera in a tiny box; as their ultimate top priority is to deliver ""Tasty food with high health conscious"". Also a small sweet kind of thing in a tiny box tastes like chikki for the final bite."
"They even mention on the package about Calorie, protein, fat, fibre, Carbs content very specifically and also Allergen information. Overall 5/5 and Super experience."

The content can be improved or the cost can be bought down. Overall hygienic and good.
Ordered chef's special thali after hearing a lot about this place. The lip smacking paneer curry was tangy and satisfying and the dal makhni was yummy enough with the roti. Felt little expensive but will definitely order again. Made my day. SatisfiedüòÄ Great work keep going üëç
"Genuinely, the taste is just like homemade food. I decided to make my sad new year night special by ordering good food that would cheer me up (you know, I had to leave home after a short vacation and hence the sadness). The food from eat.fit cured my blues."
"I ordered the Chef's Special Vegetarian Thali and oh my! The packing was so damn good and compact. The quantity was perfect (not even a morsel wasted). I was impressed with the fact that the Dal Makhani did not have so much cream and tasted great (I know when I cook Dal Makhani, I dump enough cream). The pickled carrots were good.

"Food was absolutely tasty and healthy. I was not feeling well and ordered chef specials veg thali which contained paneer curry, dal, 3 roti, salad in a separate cute box, green chilli pickle. The food seemed absolutely tasty.."
I would rate the restaurant
food :-5/5
appearance :-5/5
packaging :-5/5 ( absolutely fantastic)
quantity :-4/5
taste:-4/5
"Hence, overall rating :-4/5"
Suggestion:- Increase thw quantity of food and work a bit on the taste of the food rest everything is superb.We must order from Eat.fit
Its a good option for who are fitness freaks. They just provide all the necessary details on the package like calories (and other contents ). Coming to food i say its the best quality which tastes very good. You can just have insight how much calories you are taking in.
"I didn't visit this place physically, I ordered roti kashmiri rajma, beans gajar ki sabzi. Well packed, tasty and healthy food as mentioned in the menu. Pretty impressive!"
"I have ordered a couple of times from eat.fit now, and the food is really of a good quality. It is light and mostly non spicy. The packaging is also commendable."
Although the food packing and taste is good but the Quantity of Chef'S Special Veg Thali is very less. Rs.171 for two small chapatis is insufficient and expensive.
"Tried trice from eatfit. Decent quantity, great quality & perfect packaging. Perfect food for health conscious people. Hope they continue the same service.üëçüëçüëç"
"I like the food from here. It's healthy and hygienic. Also, I like the detox drinks.The only con is the quantity, they should increase the quantity a bit."
A perfect home delivery option when you are too lazy to cook but still want to have home made food. 
"Clean, compact packaging. One doesn't need any additional utensils. "
"We ordered Chef Special Veg thali, It had Dal Makhani and paneer curry along with three chapati and salad. The chapatis were thin and soft. Curry and Dal were good in taste with no extra oil/butter. "
To my surprise there was a cute little box for dessert (the Super Food of the Day). We received a small Groundnut and jaggery chikki.
"the tofu wrap was great, but the chef spl meal is not worth the money"
"Was in a mood to have some chicken curry, but, should be healthy at the same time with home cooked touch. So here is it:"

"The dish is a pure Bliss of good home food, away from home. Keep up the good work."
"Food is good and healthy, little bit more spice needed to make food perfectly tasty. First choice for health conscious people #BeFit and also for people who are on diet."
"I am a devoted follower of Cure Fit, and love any of their new ventures."
"Eat.fit is a dream place to order from, for people who are fitness conscious, and religiously count their calories."
"Most people have the idea, that healthy food cooked in less oil, can not taste good."
"Well! If that is the case, you should definitely try Eat.fit. Food here is delicious!!"
Every item I have tried is extremely flavourful.
I especially like their Non-veg special thali and all the Chicken Bowl meals they offer under HrX Lite.
"Very neat and eco-friendly packaging. They always give a small portion of their superfoods, which I absolutely love."
I would give eat.fit 6 stars if I could. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Having heard a lot about this from the last few weeks in my friend's circle, finally gave a try on Xmas eve & oh boy, this will be my to go place when i am lazy to cook. First glance after receiving your box, the question which pops in your mind is "" Will this be sufficient?"" but once you complete the box you feel tummy full. Best part is the mentioning of the total calories along with individual breakdown of whats in it & what you gained.

chicken was not cooked in gravy. Boiled chicken added to gravy not that interesting
"This is a new go-to option for getting food deliveries, thanks primarily to Zomato's 50% off. My favourite from the menu is the vegetarian version of Keema parantha. Personally speaking, for my appetite, one stuffed parantha is enough. The parantha itself is a regular tawa parantha, filled with Tofu Keema, cut into 4 pieces. You bite into it, and you get a spicy flavour, but one that doesn't leave a chilli after taste. It came with green chutney, and the packing is quite immaculate."
"It also comes with a small portion of the Super Food of the Day. With today's order, I received a small Til Ladoo (Sesame Sweet)."

Healthy food and it tastes great as well ! Rare combo. Have been a subscriber for dinner and loved each and every menu. Please do try to add Biryani for Non Veg options since it seems to be available in Bangalore but not yet in Hyderabad.
parathas didn't look fresh and even dal was cold
way too less quantity as per price!
I ordered chef's special chicken thali two times from here.
First time food taste is very good.
Second time food quality and taste is not good.
"not at all worth money,its a plunder!"
worst salad I would have ever eaten. ordered grilled pineapple salad and pineapples were too few to even recognize they were pineapples. and the taste of salad was the worst I have ever eaten. threw it out at the bite.
there was no salad this time ..
more quantity would be nice
Please increase the quantity at same price we get much better quantity on other places
If you are fitness freak this is the best restaurant to have food. For you fitness goal. I recommend this place all the items here are of best quality and very tasty. All the details if food is written accurately. I love this place.
The best meal if you are a fitness freak. Just you'll love the quality they maintain and the food quantity. Just you'll get all the necessary details they provide you with the package. All the calories details were mentioned. It's so much necessary for who look to be fit. Very well packed and well served
Packing 5/5
Quality 5/5
Ambiance 5/5
Enjoy the food. The fruit bowl is really a great break fast to start the day with. All the food offered by the restaurant seem to be healthy. Thoroughly enjoyed the food.
I order here almost every day from work and always rate a 5 star but today I didn't get my salad or mint chutney with my paneer roti...it just came in a small white container üëé
Healthy food with good quatity. And the nutrition chart on each food items helps to check the nutrion and calories intake for healthy diet. And fluids are also good in taste.
Good hygienic food. Very pricey for the quantity. Not sufficient for 1 person. Only 3 thin chapatis. Curry finished with 2 chapatis itself. Still hungry üòí

Eat Fit ‚Äì it makes eating healthy a little more tastier and easier.
Let‚Äôs begin by first acknowledging their packaging team that has done a marvelous job of making the packed and delivered food look so good and Instagram-able :P
I‚Äôve ordered multiple times now and always received the food in less than 25 minutes which seems like a decent waiting period.
I am in love with their salads;
"The America Garden Salad with Grilled Pineapples had fresh and crunchy veggies(zucchini, baby corn & peppers), sunflower seeds, walnuts, couscous and sweet, charred pineapple with modernized, spicy tomato sauce dressing."

"Tried the ""Superfood Trail Mix"". It has got peanuts, almonds, cashews, figs, black currants, sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Majority portion is taken by figs (approx 40% is figs) followed by peanuts. Wish the proportions of all the items are the same."
Superfood Trail Mix quantity is good enough for the mid-morning breakfast and evening snack.
"Just an wow creation for healthy lunch and dinner . I'm super sensitive with outside food, eat.fit made me complete by providing healthy and rich tasty food to run a fit lifestyle ! It's really a place for certain clusters of people who gives lot of importance to fitness and diet consciousness !!"
Keep up the good work and Long way to go guys !!
By the way appreciate on packing the food effectively !
VERDICT: Save your money give it a miss.
I ordered the harissa chicken budda bowl.
"The chicken was a bit dry and the quinoa was tasteless, no flavour at all. The only good part was the tzatziki, it was good."
"For dessert they gave some ground powder, it was not good, it reminded me of something we get in temple after puja."
They gave some yoghurt in a tiny box which does not go with the flavours of the box n more over it was sour.
I hate sour curd.
Its was to expensive for what the giving you.
This eat.fit is an amazing food chain which is providing nutritious food and also tasty food with reasonable prices. Best part is the quality of the food is excellent. Please continue to provide and also add more options or variety of food menu. 10 stars.
Ordered Lucknow Chicken Biryani. The label indicates 36gms protein and all i get is 1 damn chicken piece. The labeling of the macros and the calories seems to be seriously compromised. @praharsh @harsh091
I will eat this cambodian rice everday. Please keep it in menu everyday. I wAnt to order it everyday once or twice. It is very healthy.
Amazing guy..

This is the worst restaurant ever.. please don't try ordering in this facility. They cheat by accepting ypur order and then their customer executive calls in saying the order is cancelled and hangs the phone after waiting 1 hour for food. I am a lawyer and I am going to take this up with this pathetic restaurant.
"Yummy Rajma rice :) reminded me of Dilli ke Rajma and special mention for the packing, very professional :) will definitely order again! Continue the good work"
What I ordered: Chef's Special Veg Thali
"Contents: Paneer curry, Dal, some pickled carrots, some mix Salad, and 3-rotis."
Quality: 5/5
"Quantity: 4/5 (I am not that full, and maybe that's the point of eating fit.)"
Taste: 4/5 (1 marks due to Dal Makhni)
"Remarks: I ordered for the first time from eat.fit, used coupon and got a discount of around 80 rupees (Thanks to Zomato). So, the first impression was really good as the box is having all the details about calories, proteins and carbs. Everything for me was great except Dal, it was a Dal makhni without makhann/cream so maybe that defines the different taste. Overall I am happy to eat from here and looking forward to try other things too."
"I saw the hoardings around the city and coming from Bangalore it somewhere reminded me of fresh menu and wanted to try it sometime. Saw the listing in zomato and without a second thought placed an order. I was quite excited since for someone staying away from family like me, I felt this would be a ideal place to order on a regular basis. The delivery was fast and prompt. The packaging was good but the excitement ended there the food was having a weird taste and it was no where close to a biryani, I understand it's a health menu and there would be lot of replacement for bad ingredients but the taste was no where close to a biryani and it had a very weird taste.

"After seeing a lot of promotions about this brand on Zomato and hoardings on road, I thought of ordering lunch from this eatery."
I ordered Chef's special veg thali and got the delivery within 45 mins.
The thali was packed properly and there were two small boxes which had salad and sweet dish in it.
"Dal and Paneer dishes didn't had any oil in it, even the masala was very less."
There were three normal rotis along with the thali.
I enjoyed the taste of all the dishes and would recommend everyone to try it out (particularly when they are running 50% Off promotions on Zomato).

Staying here in Hyderabad for almost close to 20 days and wanted to have some healthy food mostly for dinner. Found out about eat.fit through lot of ads in the gachibowli area and gave em' a try. 
I absolutely loved their concept and the food as well. Have ordered from here 4 times now in the last 2 weeks or so.  The rice bowls for 3 times and the Parantha meal for once.

No compromise on taste and very very healthy. Just love this place. Each and everything is super tasty. It has become my everyday meal option.super hygenic Good job.

"Before ordering food from this place, I never knew healthy food can be this tasty. I have ordered Sindhi chicken and roti combo. All the items were so tasty. The quantity was also good for a person. The ""superfood of the day"" was the add-on. Zomato is giving 50% off on all the food items from eat.fit, so I found the food quite value for money."
i have ordered soy keema stuffed roti from this restaurant. taste was only ok .portion size was very less. not sufficient for one person.
not satisfied with the food.
the great thing was only packing. this restaurant has to think about their food than packaging stuff.
"Kudos to Eat.Fit for their nice and innovative venture of providing healthy yet tasty food which provides a great feeling every time you have their meal. Tried almost every item on their menu. My favourite pick till date would be Greek Chicken Wrap with Nachos and dip. Man it was Soo damn tasty and you could feel ""healthiness"" also in every single bite. Tried other usual items like the Veg and Chicken Thali. Soft shell tacos , soya paneer stuffed paratha. All of them were brilliant. So finally the day came when I ordered Chicken Tikka sub. Was very excited. The food arrived,the packaging was amazing as usual. But then when I started unwrapping the sub,I felt something awkward. I...read more"
good food
The packaging is top notch. I love the way they pack food and cutlery is wooden.
Also thank you for superfood of the day. I had it when energy levels was low and trust me it helped.
Coming to Thai massaman veg curry with brown rice... This is truly delicious to the core.
After melbourne I had different Thai cuisines around Hyderabad from past 5 years but this one beats everything. I can feel the flavor in each bite. Fresh veggies with coconut milk gravy. The brown rice is icing on the cake.
Also the calorie information is useful in keeping track of health.
Will keep ordering from this gem of a place.
The names of vegetables in the dish was not mentioned. I‚Äôm allergic to brinjal and I suppose it was part of the gravy. You should also mention which medicines are part of gravy
"I ordered Lucknow Veg biryani and Taste wise food is good, packing is good but i felt the quantity is very very less, for Rs. 200 it's not even sufficient for 1 person also. I used 50% coupon and since there was off on the price they might had reduced the quantity too...not sure thoughüòØ #disappointed #tastewise 5/5 #delivery 5/5 #packaging 5/5 #quantityissues"
Vegetarian Review~
One healthy and delicious option for meals. Ordered chefs special veg thali and veg biryani for lunch. Ordered it from their official app rather than zomato as it was @ price 119 and 149 bucks respectively while it was much more via zomato. The food was delivered on time and wasn't hot when it arrived. The packaging was so well like the best of any other delivery outlets in Hyderabad. Packaging was impressive. Received a complimentary yoga bar and sweet of the day per order. The sweet was seseme coconut laddoo and it was fine.

Eat. Fit is really very useful for food diet
I didn't understand why some people are giving 5 rating?
"Ordered Nutty Dates Pudding, I thought it's full of dry fruits but when I opened the box very less dry fruits. Guys don't except too much it's a 'Paramannam' in Telugu. Not value for money."

Good concept . Food was healthy and tasty
If the quality  of ingredients is good this is one of the best healthy meals on offer
Decent menu with options
"Roti, curry and dal - these are not the only things in a thali! I think the name should be changed. It tastes good but it is overpriced!! Packing is good!!"
"If you are looking for something healthy, this is the best place, I must say. Healthy and tasty. The food here, is healthy, tasty and hygienic as well. And they are good at both their quality and quantity. I had ""Chicken Baida Roti, Lucknowi Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Peanut Bowl, Chicken Chettinad and Aloo Rasedar from this place. And I couldn't find an issue to rate them a star less than 5. Good wishes."
"Ordered a berry blast and quantity was very less. Didn't find worth for money that was charged at all. Also, felt like it was not fresh. My expectations were quite high from this place taking price into consideration."
"Today for the first time I ordered from eat fit and I am impressed. The packaging was great so there was no spilling out, the food was really healthy yet very tasty just like home food and for someone like me who stays outside home it's really a great option. Last but not the least the super food it's yummy."
Ordered jamaican jerk chicken with grilled vegetables from online. The packing was nice. The food was really healthy n tasty. Very nicely kept everything... I like the concept too....

I ordered for the first time and really loved it.
Ordered jeera brown rice and chicken curry and believe me for the first time I liked brown rice.
"Nicely packed, hygienic and healthy."
quantity could be better
i have ordered two times from here through Zomato.
"Both the times i am surprised by the natural& unique taste, the combination of dishes in the items,packaging, especially spoons. etc."
# personally i like the 'super food'.
please continue it.
Am going to try all the items.
quantity should be little more
I ordered a rava idli combo and it was undercooked and when I asked for replacement they denied
Food with a promise of control
Its great to hv this option for someone over eater like me. Quantity was perfect and quality was good
Will update with next experience
ordered the Vietnamese veg rice bowl! everything was great but the salt was a little too much.
"I have fruit pop bowl everyday, but today it either wasn‚Äôt fresh or not properly made"
"Since last few days i'm regularly opting eat.fit for lunch, today I ordered chicken curry and jeera rice bowl, to my surprise it turned into potato rice bowl with full of potatoes and only 2 small chicken pieces, as a complimentary today they sent fried peanuts which is also bad."
"@eat.fit, i opted your food after seeing and experiencing other healthy food joints. Please check what we ordered and what you are sending, I keep on hearing good reviews slowly don't damage the reputation. Thank you"
"Fabulous healthy, fresh and very tasty food. My favourite take away on Zomato, highly recommended! The drivers always pleasant and professional. Can‚Äôt rate this place highly enough. Give it a try, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"Food taste was good, could you please try packaging without plastic."
Ordered Tofu peanut curry bowl. Packaging is very good also the taste.Got an complimentary yoga bar.please expand your services through out the city. Thanks :)
"Packaging was exceptionally good. Taste was very well balanced for a fitness intended meal. Quantity of food (daal and roti, paneer was sufficient) was not upto the price nor sufficient for 1 person meal."
I ordered Panner Soya Kheema Roll through Zomato.. the rolls we're delicious and the Pudina chutney that they gave had more of a home made chutney taste.. really a tasty combination. Super food they gave had Badam and the packaging was perfect too.
"Not sure of the calorie list they mention but the receipe definitely was low on oil and ghee and spiced appropriately (nothing less, nothing more), at the same time tasted great."
Now I am eager to try other items in their menu as well üòä
"I never understand why 'healthy' food is supposed to look clean, sophisticated and cost so damn high! Doesn't it include less oil, butter, sugar, sauces etc? And thus less time to cook too.."
"The Good Egg Sandwich was great, no doubt. Scrambled eggs with basil leaves stuffed nicely in three slices of brown bread cannot and should not go wrong."
"Nice packing, though! :)"
The food they provide is just simply tasty and healthy.
"The packaging is good, looks hygienic too."
Must try. Eat fit!
Try the chef's special thalis here.
Well I like there menu but its difficult to try it I guess..... Coz they do not accept orders even though its shows available and that too a recommendation....
"If you‚Äôre looking for both health and taste, eat.fit may not be a good option. I ordered rajma, vegetable and roti and their chole and brown rice dishes. They are definitely less oily, less spicy (which is good for health) but are bland as well. There is no taste of any ingredient which ideally should not be the case, because at the end of the day, food should be appealing to the taste buds as well."
"Ever since it started, this place has been my saviour. Eat.fit delivers food that tastes as good as a home cooked meal and is judiciously designed by keeping the carbs, proteins, fats, and fibers in place. I have tried most of the stuff from their menu and my personal favorite is Soya and paneer stuffed roti as that is low in calories and high in protein. Chef's special thali, on the other hand, comes with delicious paneer curry, dal makhani and some amazing soft phulkas. Most of the lunch and dinner items comes with the superfood of the day and that's something I find very cute and delicious. Trust me I have also fought with the delivery person for not getting my superfood as it's that...read more"
"Ordered some chicken salad and lemon jaljeera, it was very tasty and packaging was simply amazing. Kudos. The nutrition count was very useful. Also got a yoga bar complimentary"
This is dry fruits mix and close to 75g
In love with the simple everyday food. This is exactly what I was looking for. Is there a way to subscribe for daily food ? Or do we need to order it separately everyday ?
We (me and two other colleagues) ordered from eat.fit. The packaging was really nice. Since they claim healthy food it wont give your taste buds satiate feeling but they give you complete idea od nutritional value and sourcing. I ordered paneer and soy stuffed roti which came with green chutney. It tasted good.
"The other orders were srilankan tofu curry and thali that contains two rotis, palak paneer and dal. Srilankan tofu curry was little bland in taste but it was healthy. Palak paneer lack depth but dal was really good. They give roasted almonds with every meal in cute little box."
"Best place if you are looking for something healthy and filling! Ordered the superfood trail mix, it had all kind of dry fruits in generous amount. Their meals are also very good and fresh"
The food quality is good but it seems a bit overpriced. The packaging is awesome and the food is not leaked. would be great if more items in less quantity can be included in thali.
"Two days back ordered chicken & brown rice meal, in that only three small pieces of chicken is there, remaining all pieces are potato. Earlier I used order this one, but it was good quality, but now I felt like quality drop down..not worth for the price..missed items..not going to order this again.. disappointed eat fit"
"I ordered stuffed soya Keema roti and nutty dates pudding, both of them were pretty average in taste. I liked the packaging and details of calorie count which was mentioned on the package. Overall the taste would have been better."
Price-3/5
Taste-3/5
"I had ordered from EATFIT and so far I was happy but last time you never delivered my superfood and this time it went worst, the dal provided was burnt and was watery. The super food was bad in taste. Something has gone wrong with your chef. Please if possible give me my money"
Had a very bad experience with them recently. I ordered soy paneer keema roti in the evening but it tasted so bad and smelled funny. I think they delivered what they have prepared in the morning because the roti was stale . Really disappointed with the inedible food delivered in the name of health.
chicken pieces are lesser
"Ordered Non Veg thali which has 3 rotis, dal makhni,chicken curry & channa salad. Though quantity was less but it has sufficient needed proteins. Food was freash & yummy. They also mentioned nutritional chart, being a hotelier I understood how much care they've taken to produce this meal. Best of luck guys üëç"
"Love the food, hope more great varieties in food come out."
"The curries, be it veg or non veg are really delicious. Definitely one would feel having food from home. And it is really healthy as they say."
"Excellent food!!! Everything is just perfect from food packing to the food taste. And on top of it it is healthy, what else one can desire!! Keep up the good work"
"I have ordered many a times from eat.fit. I'm in love with this outlet because of their healthier food options and preparation methods. In general, the portions are very big."
"Nilgiri chicken curry with brown rice - Tasted good, although the curry was a little lesser comparing to the rice quantity."
"Dilli egg parathas - Tasted good, but the parathas got soggy, maybe they can think of better packaging ways."
Baked Kachoris with chana chat - it was the best among all the other food items that i ordered. But the kachoris were fridge cold. Chana chat was delicious and very filling.
Omelette for breakfast - tasted good and quantity was generous.
Delivery by Zomato was very quick.

This food(jamaican curry and millet rice)made me write my first ever review.The most delicious healthy meal i had today and my daughter also mentioned the same...it was served warm right with the temperature to eat. The food was delectable with right flavours where every age can enjoy the taste. Keep it up eat fit and bring these kind of foods often.
Thank you
"Lavish packing, wouldn't recommend if you are going for taste. I repeat, wouldn't recommend if you are going for taste. I repeat, wouldn't recommend if you are going for taste."
Quantity is too less
"Simply amazing. I've been waiting for a place like this to open for YEARS. These guys also add calorie value of the meal along with protein/carbs/fats breakdown, which is simply unheard of. And the food is tasty. I've ordered four meals so far and all of them have been TOP NOTCH."
"Anyone looking for fitness meals should blindly order from these guys because clearly this company has nailed everything that a true fitness enthusiast would want from his meals, from calorie planning to taste to a varying menu."
I wish you guys the absolute best and I hope you have a huge customer base soon because I really want to keep ordering from you. Cheers!
Excellent ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I ordered chicken baida roti which was described as juicy mix of chicken breast with tomato and spices. Sadly it tasted like dried saw dust. The chicken was super dry and the wrapped in a thick roti which made chewing and swallowing a chore ( inspite of the rather nice salad and mint chutney) . Unless they have a quality control in place I would not order again. I want to eat healthy but NOT badly cooked / tasteless food
Ordered vegetarian meal two days after baida roti and that was decent. Got a call from eat.fit people about the review that the food was ' frozen' ( ????) And they assured better quality control. Anyways told them since the vegetarian options are better I will strictly...read more
"Ordered Nutty Dates Pudding where description of this item says it contains almond, cashew, raisin, but one needs a magnifying glass to trace them. Expected a lot by reading description. Really dissatisfied"
"Ordered Hakka Noodles tastes good,But cost is high for the quantity provided. Healthy food is good concept by Cult. Can improve much quantity for Hyd Foodies"
Ordered brown rice n chicken curry.
Got the below two as accomplishments.
Quantity is more than enough for a person and the dishes are fresh.
Packing is also good.
I felt that curry had a little less salt and added salt for taste.
Good for diet goers and people who want to try something different
"Ordered chef special veg meal, taste is good. Its like home cooked food, paneer and dal makhani was tasty and salad was also fresh and tasty. Keep it up n serve us healthy food."

Ordered fruit pop oat meal bowl tastes good for health.... Mix of fruits and Chia seeds..
"Ordered chicken curry with jeera brown rice..... Tastes good... They provided with salad cucumber, carrot and tomato.. And one sweet ball tasted good atlast.... Quantity will be enough for 1person who are on diet....I love the way, they made food very tasty and free of oil..."
restaurant could have provided little rice and sweet
food is good but I got less quantity
"Eating healthy food, taking account of calories intake is becoming important these days. Eat.fit is catching up with this trend very effectively."
"I heard a lot about eat.fit so finally gave it a try. The best thing that I liked about them is how they treat their first-time customers. First order costs you only 99 whatever be the price of the thali if you are ordering from cure.fit app. The Chef's special Veg thali which costs around 160,I got it for 99.On top of that, they also sent one protein bar with it as a small gift because it was my first order.The second best thing about it is that the amount of effort they put in their packaging.

"I ordered chef special meal it included paneer curry, black dal, 4 rotis, salad and healthy food of the day. The food was looking fresh and was packed nicely. Taste was very similar to home cooked food. They put a sticker on the box which has all the nutrition information about the food."
"Ordered veg thali , i feel they can improve taste of food and the qantity as well."
"Seems normal food , there is nothing special which makes this food chain different."
roti not fully cooked
Sand in sandwich
The food is great here. It is both healthy (as marketed) and tasty (as personally felt). It's great to have this place as an option in Hyderabad. Wish you all the luck for a good start here
"I'm so happy to finally find a place that serves real healthy food, at such an affordable price!"
I had ordered for Chicken thali and butter(less) chicken with brown rice. The quality was quite generous! Your tummy and mind will feel satisfied that you didn't have to compromise on the taste to eat healthy!
I suggest everyone to give it a fair try at least once!
I would love for eat.fit to add more to their lunch dinner and dessert menu! How about some fat free chole bhature and mutton biryani! üòú
quantity is very less
"Restaurants like these are coming up and are actually standing up to the claims of healthy-fit eating . We ordered one non veg meal consisting of chickpea , butter chicken , salad , sweet , roti and a thai meal . I was suprised with the taste such delicious food without heavy oil was expecting bland taste. Will order again"
"Very good food, with proper packing. So similar to home waala khaana and it is hygienic too. Loving the thali items. Repeated ordering and increasing love ‚ù§Ô∏è."
"I think the best thing about Eat Fit is the way they take care of their customers. With each meal, you can see how much effort and thought they have put in. I mean for my ""Superfood of the day"" I got sweetened Flax Seeds once! Their food is nutritious and packed with flavor. I also love how their menus change regularly. Every time I open their menu, it's like a surprise waiting for me. I've ordered from here quite a few times. I think I've only been disappointed by their food once- Nilgiri Chicken Korma& Rice. The chicken Korma really lacked flavor. My favorite (as of now) is the Chef's Special Chicken Thali. The dal and chicken is so tasty! Anyway, I'd highly recommend...read more"
The next pioneer in Health Food!
"EAT.FIT serves yummy healthy food in a packaging that will fascinate you, its the overall product that stands our rather than the food!"
I just feel the prices couldve been a little more competitive!
Feeling Nostalgic! Remembered those old pneumonia days when I could not go to school and had hospital food !!Sametaste hope not to go back to the same state üòÇüòâ.
I was really interested to try the food when I came accross eat.fit on zomato
"Ordered chef's special veg thali and light: 2 rotis, roast veg and tadka dal-e-lobia today for dinner"
"The food was cooked with apt amount of oil and spices like regular home made ones. The meal was nutritious as well as delicious. Loved the concept of using of less butter,less oil and natural sugar."
It's perfect for people who are health conscious
Will try out other meals soon
I ordered halka noodles and the chef's special thali from eat .fit. The packaging and the contents we're very neat and presentable the food was up to mark. They really used minimal oil and spice it was a hearty meal and the laddo they gave completed the meal without any guilt.
"I do order regularly, recently ordered Feta cheese Greek salad which is worst item, reason is apart from cucumber, tomato, cabbage, nothing is there in it..too much price..not worth for money this item..fill the bowl with some other healthy veggies, & where is the cheese in it ? I felt worst item in your eat.fit menu.thanx"
Ordered food before I boarded by train . Was little hesitant about the portions and taste . To my surprise I enjoyed the meal to the fullest . Happy tummy and just right food for body . I just got one decent and healthy option to be fit
Hygiene 10/10
"Was just swiping through zomato n discovered eat.fit. the cult.fit food venture. I was really excited to what they bring in. Tried veg combo for lunch. 2 chapati, lauki kofta with curd base, beetroot curry."
"The food was really light.. exactly Ghar Wala. No extra oil, curry seemed very fresh. I loved the beetroot curry. Tossed n steamed properly."
The packaging is perfect. It states the calories and other nutrition breakdown as well.
Price is slightly high. But u can get it at lower prices for subscription from their app I guess. The quality is really good.
Must try.
"cool packaging, simple subtle food, fast delivery"
"( and yes, calories/nutritional value break up on the pack. Yes, even on good ol veg thali) Good value for money and kinda food you can order more regularly as its more on flavor less on spices. Menu keeps changing on different days and time so good variety on offer. One person will mostly need to order at least any two portions ‚ò∫"
Peace ‚úå
"Good quality food provided by them good packaging, ordered chapatti with curry for lunch. which is not ideal for a person I guess but overall loved it....."
Ordered food from eat and fit delivery was on time and the taste was excellent but need to improve quantity or less the price. Thanks for your tasty food.
"Well the packing is good. Quantity is OK if you eat less. I ordered chicken thali , taste of dal makhani anf chicken is good and even feels less oily and healthy though the quantity is little less but its OK . The only disappointment for me is roti...it was cold and not freshly prepared considering you are only getting 3 rotis with sabji . I hope its a one time mistake . I am giving this experience a 3.5 star."

And when I started eating, I felt so satisfying, because I was longing to eat such light, healthy and tasty food since a long time! It was so damn light and so damn tasty! They also packed some flaxseed jaggery sweet, and that tasted fantastic as well! I'm quite impressed. It really is healthy.

less quantity
Im surprised delivery of food is almost never available. Been trying to. Order for three days now it always closed for ordering. At least it will be helpful. If timings are clearly mentioned. Hope service improves quickly. Looking forward to taste some food here.
Healthy and tasty food
"Food is actually quite good. Instead of craving on junk food, this is a good option. The quantity they give is also sufficient, even for a snack sized meal. Packaging is done well - similar to fasos. Cost is a little high, but I would rather buy this than cheap junk food."
"I was really fascinated when I found this delivery-only place on Zomato. The concept of ""healthyfying"" even the kind of junk tasty food heart craves for on weekend is great!"
I had ordered Butter(less) Chicken and Brown Rice pulao for my dinner. The chicken curry claimed to have be a metamorphosed Butter Chicken without Butter/Cream.

2nd Order:
Veg Thali containing:
"Gobi mattar masala: I love dry Gobi sabzi, and it was cooked nicely."
Masoor dal: perfect for my taste. I am in habit of eating very less salt in my food. So it was perfect for me.
Rotis were like home Tawa Chapatis. Lemon they served along was very small and had almost no juice so I guess they can give a bit bigger size of lemon.
