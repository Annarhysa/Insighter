Reviews
This place specializes in smoothies as well as healthy juices. I visited it and tried their choco nutella milk shake along with chicken grilled sandwich.
The milk shake tasted so good that I took back home a horlicks meal along with nut case smoothie.
The chicken sandwich also tasted really good. It has a really nice seating area with a relaxed ambiance
"Excellent recipes, natural tastes, well crafted blends, served fresh, prompt service, all well. Bottle instead of glass would be great"
good
Bloody delicious mate .finally found something to fill the void in my soul .
Sugar is added in the smoothie

"This is a small outlet located at Kondapur. Here the shakes are Good in taste wise, quality and quantity wise as well. They do have 4 menu‚Äôs (which covers everything like starting from all types of chocolate shakes, healthy shakes, fruit shakes, diet shakes etc). They also do have some games to play like cards, board games."
Here I have tried :
Choco Nutella Shake
Caramel Kitkat Shake
Strawberry Magic Nutella Shake (This can be improved)
"Taste could have been better. The drink was watery and not at all sweet. Also, it wasn‚Äôt as cold as smoothies are supposed to be."
the smoothie tasted a bit off. not sure why
taste was great. but didn't see any Chia seeds or Basil seeds. I paid extra for the chia seeds
smoothie prices are high
This is just sugar water. No brownie no shake! Just water worst experience
worst packing...it's damaged
"It said no additional sugar, but the product tastes otherwise. It is full of additional sugar."
very blunt
Taste is not at all good . I ordered mirror mirror which is a mix of carrot apple and lime but I believe they added plenty of water .this costed 170 and I‚Äôm not at all satisfied with the taste.
it's not water melon juice. it's just melon Water.... waste of money we can eat 4 water melons with that cost.
"it was full watery, we have ordered the regular once but this look more cheap for the price with full of water and no real taste"
Guys I ordered for a smoothie not for water. Too watery and no taste at all. Terrible!
"full throttle is combination of beetroot, apple and carrot. where as I got is full thick pulp of beetroot. which is sour in taste not at all drinkable. when you make any recipe or combo taste is the main factor . even I have cold press juicer at home, and I can directly extract beetroot juice."
stale taste. nuts used or spoiled. its expensive but not tasted goo
Better Identify near Juice shops and have it
Over priced
they didn't clean fruits before using them I could feel the sand particles while drinking
drink is not up to mark
it is more of water
lime taste is not there
This place serves variety of shakes. It is a good place to have chat with friends. The seating space is less though.
Amazing just amazing didnt expect this bowl would taste great. Would recommend everyone just give a try u would love it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Highly recommended healthy food
"I really liked this underrated place. They have foosball table, board games. And juices options are also very good."
Muskmelon lemon hydrator electrolyte - 4/5
The owner is very welcoming and the drinks are also very decent.
The irish coffee is a must try.
"Although they have variety of shakes, but they lag in finger food."
They should introduce some new options to compliment their drinks
Orderered online. Amazing taste and good presentation too.
Free WiFi and board games..nice place for couples nd kids..got a grilled cheese sandwich for just 99..loved water melon electrolyte üòã
Loved it overall
üéâüéâTHIS PLACE IS A MUST VISITüéâüéâ
"Best ever milkshakes I have ever had. The brownie shake was the outstanding product from my experience. The product is perfectly worth the price. The concept of glass bottles and paper straws has completely thrilled me. The unique menu card is confusing but exciting to go through because of the available options. The fun games, guitar and other quotations make the place even more attractive."
"Overall,"
"Ambience, Cleanliness, Worthiness of the product- 5/5."
"It was Really a Hangout place with friends and Families.....The Part 2 is Simply Awesome And The Stuff Was ADORED and a NYC talk with them.....Especially The ambiance Are Super Games, Guitar, Cycle.....I will Definitely Vist it again.....NEVER STOP DOING U R BEST"
Nice place to hang around with your girl. Tried foos ball game.It is absolutely free and we had fun.
Chicken tandoor sandwich and cold coffee cappuccino were superb ..highly recommend this place
"Such an innovative place to be , they kept some board games for customers to play with while waiting for the order, I had nice coffee and service was better than most places"
Had a monkey confidential part 1 and I must say I was surprised by its taste. And it's very healthy too. Will definitely have monkey confidential part 2
"The worst juice ever, the content had more than water."
Worst watermelon and sweet lime juice.
"The service was super slow. With no customer other than 2 of us, it took half hour to give 2 juices."
Please refrain from this international brand serving only water and go with traditional juices.
I visited the shop expecting refreshment and wanted to order regular smoothies.
"But, the shop has included latest mango offering collection."
"Having doubts, I asked the person there which mangoes are being used in the recipe. Guess what....he was clueless. His response was ""company se aaya hai, achcha hai...""."
"I didn't want to order mango recipe if it's banganpalli, as I am fond of Alphonso. But, hearing his response, I ordered one recipe of the collection."
"To be honest, the taste was so average that I would have gotten a better mango juice for 40 rs. anywhere else in Hyderabad and they charged me Rs. 188/-."
"I mean, seriously, do you even take feedback from your customers...read more"
"They didn‚Äôt include the baked pita chips, and the bread was falling apart. The cold coffee taste good, but it was a little warmer. Probably won‚Äôt order food from here again."
"Best place for healthy drinks also huge variety of shakes I ordered choco shake and Oreo shake was thick and very tasty, pretty decent ambience."
"Favorite outlet for indulgence shakes and hangover curbing beverages! They prepare a fresh order every time, hence the better taste. Try out their last nite's sin"
It smells really bad
"Visited this place yesterday, staff are friendly and polite. They gave us good suggestions on what to choose based on the flavors we like. One of the best place to hangout , couple of board games maintained at this outlet.. We ordered Oreo Shake and Black Current Shakes they were so yummy üòä ‚ò∫ I can feel the taste of real fruit in Black Current. kudos team."
"Good smoothies and the best thing is all ingredients used are natural. However, it is on the expensive side. Can be great if rates are reduced."
New outlet opened in Hyderabad for milkshakes.Tried nuts abt caramel milkshakes.It was very good in taste and quantity was also very good .Shake contained dry fruits with caramel milkshake.
I am sucker of smoothies and i love the fact that Drunken Monkey has the innovative and healthy range of smoothies added to the list.
You cant complain about not able to enjoy smoothies when you are on diet! Oh yes! Tried the Mirror Mirror smoothie which is really good and one of the best ingredients added for detoxification. The green smoothie looks terrible and I was expecting it to be gross. But Voila! The apple added to it makes it a bit sweet and not so gross. Still okay.. (healthy stuffs are not tasty) .. and the brownie shake was good! Its not like the avalanche based or Gelato based. Its kind of milk and brownie mixture.
The bottles are attractive. I have grown a habit of...read more
quality and quantity is very poor not up to the mark and they didnt even provided spoon and straw so i will never opt this again i suggest you to improve your service in a better way
good service
I had chico milk shake that was top notch and i tried other flovers those are also good not to best for my taste. Amabiance awesome and service as well
Very Tasty and my favourite is Nut Case. Absolutely healthy.
Only natural sugar used.
I recommend to try these drinks.
Try Nutcase and Sultan drinks.
Ordered Date Night - 3/5 .. quality and richness in the milkshake are top notch but taste is average
"Irish cream coffee - 4.5/5 , As a fan of coffee i just loved it and it became my fav in this place . Kudos ."
Cost is little bit expensive compared to the quantity
But the complimentary glass jars given along with milkshake are great ...
"Ordered ""Sultan"" milkshake. As advertised, it was way too rich and heavy - full of nuts and dates. Could have been a little less sweeter to make it a perfect combination!"
The coffee Nutella magic shake was awesome. We liked the place . They have various games over there. Good place to have some cold milk shakes or smoothies and play games.
"Not much to write here, but I have always wondered, and I still do, why are shakes and juices priced so mind-numbingly high at some joints."
This is that joint.
It could well have been named 'Fancy Joint for the Drunken Monkey'.
"The bottling is cool, the shakes are heavy and loaded with content. But the glass packaging doesn't justify the quantity of fruit inside."
Delivery Review.
Food - 4
VFM - 4
Packing - 5
Delivery - On-Time
"Ordered Brownie Thick Shake. The shake was yummy and chocolatey, it had chocolate brownie ground into the drink. Only complaint is that, the shake should be a bit more thick."
Loved the bottle :).
"Orderd 2 times till now from you people via zomato, the first milk shake choco nutella shake was great, the second one was underwhelming to say the least, the jalapeno cheese fries I ordered after talking to you guys I came to know they are only normal fries sprinkled with some spices, that was not what I was expecting I expected melted cheese with jalapeno slices, but the problem lies probably in the fact that you have not put up photos of your menu items , kindly make sure you do it will help a lot when I order food in the future"
"This is my favourite place for a quick grab of juices...I had earlier visited this outlet in indiranagar Bangalore. I have tasted all their juices and shakes, the best I liked so far is Oreo shake, watermelon and kiwi"
Just had super fiber meal.. hoped the drink might be little more thicker. Over all place and price is okay. Quality should be maintained for branding themselves. Good idea .. if they do better
forgot to give sauce
"This place amazes me every time, i have a huge collection of its bottles now."
"Delivery on time, well packed."
"Tried spinach juice, healthiest option on the menu."
"Nut case containing almonds, figs. Its super delicious."
"The ambience is pretty decent but one does not pay for the ambience alone. In the name of Cheddar and Cheese fries they gave us something that did not even come close to that name. The drink that we ordered was Summertime Madness. Probably because it was not Summertime, it really fell short of out expectations. Three stars for the boardgames they have stacked up, cleanliness, service and the bottle that we get to take home."
Drunken Monkey is a whole sole place for some nice healthy drinks. You have got a huge variety of different shakes. My personal favourites are Oreo shake and Nutella shake. This was my second experience with drunken monkey. Shakes are pretty filling and tasty. I have also ordered corn spinach sandwich and cheese sandwiches which were a good option for breakfast.
didn't get straw
I didn't receive straw..And also the bottle is not completely filled..even the shake is not that much tasty
Bad taste..
Received wrong item
delicious milkshakes
superb
shake was good..but it is very expensive compared to wat was served
"Good place to hangout with friends. They have different options of shakes, they are very tasty and must try . There are not many Snack options. And i think these people need to increase there number of snack options"
super
good
Smoothies not served chilled
Absolutely no consistency in the drinks! The texture varies every single time!!
This is one big trouble with drunken monkey.
dry fruits taste is not good
Nutcase and oreo red velvet shake are delicious.
Everyone must and should try..
Taste is really good and we can see the quality ingredients.
I love the smoothies here. Luscious!
Try almond one.
Packaging is also good. Quantity n quality deserves 5 star. They have consistent taste on all outlets
üëç
I have ordered nut case and poker case with ice cream mixed.but got worest product.there is no cooling and taste is too worest and not thick shake.i have ordered with ice cream mixedit with be surely thickly.bit I got very loosely product.dont go for drunken monkey.if you go for this surely you will lost money for product..beacuse products not good for online food order
"I don't really write long reviews (time being the factor), but when one deserves you have to oblige. So here I am, giving out one. I have been to this place quite a few times and with every time they have only impressed me more which is hard. My favorite pick from here is ""Nut Case"". I can go on and on talking about its taste but I am going to refrain since when you taste it you would have your description of it. Out of their 160 odd flavors, I have only tasted a few and all of them did not fail to impress me."
"Now coming to the very reason I wanted to write this review, it is their service. I am going to give out the names because they deserve an applause."

Crazy super smoothie was okay not great compared to nut case smoothie
milkshake is very tasty
I did not like it
"I am a big fan of their Smoothie Meals and on this visit I tried their Nutella Meal [Rs.159 plus taxes], Horlicks Meal [Rs.159 plus taxes], Nut Case [Rs.159 plus taxes] and Grilled Chicken Sandwich [Rs.149 plus taxes]."
"Firstly about my favorite ""Horlicks Meal"", it is a blend of cornflakes, muesli, cashews, almonds and horlicks. It is very heavy as it has got lot of fiber and it is also not too sweet. My next favorite is the ""Nutella Meal"", it is also made with a blend of muesli, apple, cashews, almonds and nutella. It is a bit sweet and also thick."
"I did not find ""Nut case"" smoothie that special. It is made with a combination of figs, almonds, cashews and...read more"
We had ordered dry fruit milkshake and quantity is good but taste not good and it is contained more sugar. And it is looks like more sweety with different taste.
I have ordered 1 cheese sandwich & choco almond sandwich was worst milk shake is okay
i ordered for cream and onion fries ... but i only got a simple classic fries.
"nuts included seeds from dates,which made it hard to drink and relish the nuts.it caused toothache.i think they should be more careful while preparing the shake.otherwise ull definitely lose your customer base and tooth of customers too"
Good
sandwich was not crispy and juice was not cold
delicious shakes
The drink has papers in it. I had half of it
good delivery
"Professional service, mouthwatering shakes..Got addicted to this place now . Contemporary dishes with latest menu, so you will not get bored of"
it was tasting good but there wasn't much brownie in it . i hope next time you'll add a bit more
"Looks expensive at first go, But upon knowing that ingredients used are of premium quality with high health oriented, worth extra bucks to enjoy a healthy drink!!"
delivered earlier than expected. good attitude by the delivery person. totally satisfied with the service
goog
Wish the quantity was more
Coffee-Nutella Magic was really nice! Though I bought it for their awesome bottle :)
Best shakes with natural fruits and flavor.
The best part of there menu is they won't use and artificial preservetives.
Combo of detox drink is best of there menu
good
AWESOME!
Best shake ever!!
"I guess drunken monkey turns into a lazy monkey sometimes! I have ordered nutella meal and everytime I ordered it, the drink was filled with lots of nuts. This time, it was just a smoothie! There were no nuts in it! It‚Äôs purely a waste of money. No consistency in the recipes."
it was terrible
goood
Feels like drinking flavoured water. Don't think they have delivered what I have ordered.
Loved the food.
Every non veg should try their Shredded chicken sandwich. It tastes amazing. The shakes here are just awesome. A must visit place.
"Nice Smoothie ,Nice Bottle to Store"
Extremely nutty and superb choco almond shake. Good bottle packaging too. It is a must try. The dry fruit meal was thick enough and was not too sweet.
v gd
Pineapple shake was bitter in taste and it was not good
good taste and neat pack. so I give the rate 5 out 5
Nice place to hang out..Good for health conscious people..Overall great.
"We tried lemon chiller and it was great...Overall loved the ambience. ,,"
Mismatch product
shakes were fine just couldn't take it from the leaking bottle
super b....
We had ordered Choco milkshake from this place and it was yummy.Also I liked the glass bottle .It was cute. Great taste and yummy milkshake.Price was not too costly.
Awesome quality and variety of juices .Good for health conscious people.I felt that milkshakes are like they are made in home.I hope the space of the cafe would improve.
Don't ever and ever but milkshake from here. From next time I will not buy milkshake from here
Excellent! Could feel the genuine taste...
"This place was aweaome... I have visited other outlets in hyderabad but kondapur one was awesome... I would like to explicitly thank 2 employees of Drunken Monkey who hosted us, i am so sorry, i did not ask your names..!!! If you would recollect us we were the last one to go and if you see this review, thankyou so much for hosting us awesomly if such a word exist...!!"
I like milkshakes from this place and i usually have ordered online. Have had choco almond shake and oreo shakes from this place and loved it. Moreover the bottles in which they serve the shakes are very sexy are love them‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
"This place has a very good ambience and many varieties of shakes, smoothies and juices. Well, I have tasted coffee oreo and I must say I loved it. Also I liked the presentation of drink in a glass bot le. Looking forward to visit this place again"

good
"Need something to chill yourselves out? Get out,and reach the drunken monkey. Variety of shakes and chillers at a god price. Actually for the quality they provide, it's quite a good deal. Don't forget their complementary bottles"
worth the money
It's great smoothies and fruit juices for health conscious people.2nd time I ordered from Dry fruit meal and Forbidden Detox awesome smoothies.amazing health drinks ever had anywhere before !! and thanks to Zomato
dry fruits were not grinded properly. large size nuts. poor quality.
good
it can be called water shake...90%water 10%chocolate ....hated it...
Slow
Sandwitch not so good
healthy one but taste I don't like...I thought it is a meal but it is drink
"This a lovely place to have a sip of health. They serve some of the best smoothies, milk shakes and there is a wide variety of drinks to chose from. We had ordered an Irish coffee milkshake (cannot remember the exact name but was something like that) and a strawberry drink fused with some watermelon."
The ambience is soothing with some dim light and lot of board games to keep you busy till your order arrives. The staff was friendly and courteous.
The best part is that you get to keep those lovely bottles with you..üòä
good
Good
bitter kiwi shake. didn't like the combination. and watermelon combination was also not spot on! healthy drinks done need to suck!
it's ok but prices are too high for the products
good
The sweetness was on the higher side.
loved it
"What do i say about this place... i have never tasted a good milkshake like the ones which you get here for the price they are serving... i have tasted their green grape, nuts fully loaded, Irish coffee cream, Coffee with nutella, Banana everything tasted just amazing.. The best part of this place i love is their take away's, they fill up your milkshake in an amazing glass bottle guess i haven't seen any milkshake shops giving take aways in bottles. People try this place out i am sure you will start loving it... Drunken Monkey is a place for milkshakes. They are always on top of my list if i am going to look for a good milkshake. Summer is here and i am sure they can fill up that thirst.."
Awesome as always
"Sultan Shake is delicious. Cashews, Almonds, Figs. Amazing."
Nice taste
Superbbb Choco shake really Loved it üíó
taste good
super
I had ordered for All star Shake. The shake was extremely sweet ... couldn‚Äôt really finished it ... the ingredients were not really in balanced quantity and tasted bad.
Would not recommend this shake even if sounds n looks pretty tempting.
"I ordered for a choco almond shake from kondapur branch of drunken monkey and the they sent me a chocolate shake with few cashew nuts at the bottom of the shake. I don‚Äôt really understand how cashews came in the place of almonds and how there are very little cashews in a bottle full of shake. Probably the people at drunken monkey got lazy as the day passed! I ordered at almost 10:30pm. If the service changes according to the place and according to the branch, then there‚Äôs no point in calling it a chain."
The kiwi shake was bitter in taste . Couldn‚Äôt drink
ok
very bad ....I ordered a thick shake but it is a normal one ...try to improve your service
"In case, you find it a bit difficult to locate this particular outlet of drunken monkey - It is located nigh on to Kims hospital. Meanwhile, Heatwave in Hyderabad that is soon to bring higher temperatures has heated up the buildings around and yet, the temperature inside the eatery was agreeable. It is a small decent place to satiate your cravings for milkshakes, fruit juices (Pure natural fruit, No preservatives added, No added sugar), smoothies, detox drinks, and protein shakes. The place had a nice cozy feel with warm lights and neatly built wooden interiors. They also serve few scrumptious dishes - We have ordered Cheese grilled sandwich and it tastes really good."

Drunken Monkey - The best place for drinks and Quick bite food.
This place is easy to find its on the main road of kondapur road beside Kim's hospital .
ambience is good and innovative.
you can spend some valuable time of yours with games and some comic books which is a nice thing here.
coming to the service they are very polite and friendly in explaining us to select our fav drink.

Courteous staff and great preparation. Big fan of this place. I also loved their meal smoothie concept. #justwritingtocomplete140characterspleasedon'treadthisif youarestillreadingwhatiswrongwithyouhence140completed
if there is some thing less than one ..I want to give that rating...taste of the shake is worst ...brownie tastes like as if they soaked a biscuit in water and have added it ...
the good thing...is glass bottle...which is looking good....
will never order from drunken monkey... Shakes at Thick Shake Factory are very tasty!!!
please tell drunken Monkey team to learn recipes from TSF
awesome drink

"Drunken monkey serves the fresh fruit smoothies, juices and shake. They have 130 varieties in their menu and no added colors , preservatives. sounds great right!"
We've tried to many flavors and many are so tasty and delicious. My personal favorites are nut case which is loaded with nuts very creamy and tasty.
"Browine Shake just can't get over it. Very delicious, thick cream and browine blast in every sip. Must try."
"Another favorite flavor is fig, strawberry and watermelon."
And they have savory dishes too they are lip smacking.
A perfect place for evening's. Service is too good.
Drunken monkey 
"It doesn't show exactly in google maps but it is next to the kims building,parking for cars is a bit problem and the place is full of warmth with nice wooden interiors."
This place got all the required juices and drinks from milkshakes to detox and to whey protein shakes.
"It has even got the savory dishes too, which are lip smacking."
"My best of all shakes are choco brownie, nut case , red velvet   and to hydrate your self go for strawberry lime electrolyte."
over all rating 4/5

Too much lime in strawberry juice
"Lovely juice, juice is tasty, heavy with nuts and also chilled. I would recommend juice if you are looking for a protein rich juice."
super
there has been change in the quality / ingredients ( for worse) of dry fruit meal.
Nice beverage but not chilled and they informed me also
Nice shakes especially Choco almond and cold coffee classic.
#byinvite #tastingsession
the place was well lit with warm lighting
the brownie shake is my favorite here
in food the cheese grill sandwich was amazing :)
if you want any refreshing drink then go with strawberry lime electrolyte 
even the banana shake and nut case shakes are shizz
"The avocado was bitter! It literally left a bitter taste in the mouth ... quite disappointed with the quality of many of their juices lately, to be honest :-("
"Been here a few times, never ceases to amaze me!!!!!!!! awesome taste and cool combinations ,‚ô•DrunkenMonkey #drinkhealthy #drinkdifferent!!!"
worst juices had ever tasted.. can't feel the original flavour of the fruit. and charges toomuch
not at all good and didn't follow the instructions. the Coffee Caramel is not thick and doesn't taste like coffee
taste can be much better
good
I ordered almond shake and it was great
Not up to the mark. One of the drink was not chilled and consistency of the drinks is too runny not thick what‚Äôs given in the store.
very late delivery
"Have ordered a few times now. And never found a drink to be balanced in taste. Plus, it always has this artificial sweet taste at the end. Quite disappointed. Again. Would love to see something regular like a juice instead of just concoctions on the menu."
"Had ordered classic cold coffee, it was yum. Came in cute bottle which I can keep :), haven't visited the place as I ordered online, looking forward to visit this place. Thank you for lovely coffee."
Naturally High This is the word which came into my mind after i have tasted the smoothies!!! 
Found new place to hangout! Thanks for bringing back childhood memories with indoor games :) 
Such a wide range of menu for all the smoothie lovers in a more healthy way with no sugars!!
Ambience - 5/5
Quality - 5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Wasn't cold and was way too sweet
delivery was late
food was not labeled properly and coffee Brownie was not good as we have had before. all over it was very disappointing.
"I tried the dry fruit meal and the super detox. Both were good, but overpriced. They should moderate their prices to reach more market."
not so cool.
"was served chicken sandwich, for I ordered cheese corn and I am Jain and I are half of it. this has hurt my religious sentiments and I have also got nausea. I would like a compensation."
HE has good patience to wait

"Very good ambience and very great taste. happy to come to this place and have a pleasant evening with a healthy drink. The best thing i find in this place is the bottles they give with the drink, they look really beautiful"
very nice and healthy

Tried Classic coffee and Choco both the milkshake are great and the best part is we can keep the bottle üòÅ. good quality and quantity shakes and not. too heavy on Pocket. Must try this place üòä"

"Badly packaged, it was leaking at the time of delivery"

The best ever
"This is a gem of a place. Awesome range of healthy meals and smoothies. Nutella meal is my personal favourite. And after the recent Zomato offer, had ordered 8 times in March. Both dining and delivery experience is fantastic. I would highly recommend it."
misplaced orders...
choco almond shake was tastier as before.
"I had ordered dry fruit meal, instead I got kind of shake which was bitter in taste and got it wasted. I Felt like been cheated."
Awesome delivery and awesome taste..cheersüëçüòä
it was disgusting..
good
Your delivery guy has updated the order as delivered 15 minutes before it was actually delivered. He made a excuse for the same.
very good taste... really awesome
I ordered in drunken monkey only for the bottles and really loving the bottles.
good
the frappe was disappointing.it lacked consistency and was slightly more creamy than coffee
a good way to detox your body
nice good
coffee flavour is very mild
This is called Quick services.
Nutella meal is just awesome!!
Suffered with vomiting and nausea after having the shake.
I have ordered 2 different flavors not sure how I can I identify the difference between 2 of them without giving any sign
Worst experience ever
Loved Smoothies here.A good place to order drinks. All of our colleagues like this a lot. It's like every alternate working day we are ordering something or either from this place.
The red velvet milkshake just tasted like plain strawberry milk! The only good thing that I have got out of it is the glass bottle in which the milkshake was delivered! Huge disappointment
I ordered because they deliver fruits and dairy not anything mix but in my order they mixed it with ice cream not fruits which I did not like at all . taste was also bad.
good
superb
it is not cool avg taste
was very dehydrated after a crazy overnight party
ordered a couple of these from drunken monkey
the watermelon : this is absolute pure bliss
the hangover drink: could taste better but damn I chugged the whole thing down
will not look back to a different place when Im craving for something refreshing
10/10 would recommend
"I had ordered a smoothie, unfortunately the delivery boy delivered a wrong package to me. I was frustrated & called both drunken monkey & zomanto, to my surprise they handled the situation swiftly and both DM & Zomanto ensured I get what I ordered. As a foodie it was not pleasant but sometimes such things happen beyond control. I am super impressed the way this was handled."
good
We have ordered from here many times and also once went to the outlet. The cold coffee shakes are very good especially the brownie shake and oreo shake. But the smoothies and the fruit juices are regular in taste. They are a bit overpriced for the regular fruit juices and shakes. The outlet is good and they have a zenga for time pass.
Lime sweet electrolyte was amazing. The packaging in the glass bottle added to its taste
It was just a late night online delivery from the place and I must say that I wasn't disappointed at all by them. Ordered a couple of sandwiches and they were decent in taste. The packaging was nice . Would love to try other items as well in coming time.
Today I had the worst brownie sake from this restro. It was only brownie shake I don't know why they added banana n badam and other stuffs a lot rather than brownie. Guys order at your own risk. One small suggestion to the restro team instead of wasting your money in that Glass container for serving u can work on how to improve its taste.
Good.. Tasty
In love with the Nut Case smoothie üòã
"I loved the Choco Almond shake, the best part being that sweetness level was perfect. I got this ordered in the late hours and had no problem with the delivery."
To add on I love the bottles in which the drink was served !!
Shake was too plain....not thick at all
not a real smoothie. could refrain from using ice cream and sugars and use thick yoghurt as a base
The choco shake was definitely amazing but unfortunately the bottle was broken near the lid because of which I cut my finger while opening it. It would be great if u ensure the quality of bottles before delivery
Cucumber Electrolyte can be better..it was more bitter for a drink..
on
Not that thick
seeing some bugs in App
This place is perfect for sitting and sipping a tasty drink. The staffs are friendly. Very good service. The price is bit high though. But the drinks are too tasty. I tried red velvet and brownie choco. Both were good. Its filling. Ambience is nice.
Summer is here! üòâ
Shake could be a little colder. It was at room temperature and have to keep in the fridge for a while before I could have it!
"No avocado was there being Avocado smoothie ,only spinach n apple for which they are charging 229 /- .. complete waste of money.."
"A few days back I had ordered the confidential monkey part 1 shake. It was good so today I opted for the confidential monkey part 2 shake, which was double the price so I thought the quantity would be double as well."
"When it came I found out it was the same size and the price was so inflated just because there was chocolate in it, along with the ingredients of the part 1 shake."
I am feeling very cheated by drunken monkey and have spoken to them about the same. The customer service was also not satisfactory since they did not have any explanation as to why the price was so high. I was simply told that it was a new drink and that there was chocolate along with the fruit ingredients. I...read more
Best place to have some refreshing drinks and have some chat with your friends..i feel so underrated place when it comes to the quality and the taste
This place have juices of various flavours and options to mix and match various combinations.
"Apart from the juices they have variety of cold coffee options too.I tried Irish cream coffee , which had a nice texture and was less sweet too."
I found prices for the juice relatively higher.
"They give your drinks in a cool take away glass bottles , which is an added plus :)"
Good staff great service excellent smoothie tried nutcase excellent taste I loved it impressed by the taste wanna try other drink too best spot to hang on wid frnz
"Mr. Anil was good at his service, he was good at guiding people based on their personal preferences of what they would like to drink. Brownie drink was the best of all I had"

Been here on a biting cold evening with my childhood friend.....
#TooGoodAMusic : we were tapping our feet at the playlist because most of them were coincidentally our favs
#GelUpWithAmbience : Ambience is perfect for a quality hangout...cafe style but there's dine out touch...board games n jenga...literally took us back to our childhood...too many selfie options...and a guitar is just everything during such times

"I have always ordered online from this place. The coffee nutella magic milkshake was really yum. The oreo one wasn't that great as it didn't feel thick enough. What I really like are the bottles in which they give the milkshakes,they look really good. Overall a decent place to have milkshakes."
"Juices call for drunken monkey. Their watermelon juice, hangover shake and chikko milkshake with dates are worth trying. Also, if you are having a hectic day and want something refreshing, cucumber juice is the one you can always opt for."
"This outlet has the same interior setup as the Madhapur one. They have a new refreshed menu and included many new things. They have introduced shakes, cold coffee, hot beverages, detox, protein smoothies and few quick bites. The person managing the place explained us well and We ordered choco Nutella shake for our daughter. She loved the place and enjoyed every sip of the shake. We would try their new smoothies in the next visit."
The person at the store named Anil was very soft spoken and explained about the various combinations in the menu very well. Good to see someone new to place being so informative.
Ambience 5 star............
Food 5 star...........
Service 5 star..........
Totally we enjoyed...........
Must visit place....................
It's a awesome place for refreshment....me and my friends have a good fun it DRUNKEN MONKEY.....The place simply amazing for relaxation....It was a nice weekend
"A casual place to hangout with your friends and family situated in kondapur area , great ambience ,good variety of smoothies and milkshake ,was literally spoilt with choices but finally at last we decided to order nutella milkshake , it took them almost 15 mins to bring our order so we were wonderful how long does it take to make a milkshake but when we had the milkshake we were extremely delighted by the crunchiness in the freak shake therefore makes it a must try place for all smoothies and milkshake lovers"
This place is very close to our house and thought of trying out few juices during evening time.
First thing I loved about this place was the ambiance.It has a very cool decor with games kept around for playing.
Infact we really had fun playing Zenga and sipping our juice.
"However, the thing I did not like much was they use sugar free pouches instead of no sugar.I believe if it is no sugar concept in their beverages, they should ask customer before adding artificial sugar into it."
Prices are on higher side and the quantity served is less according to prices we pay.
If I would go again it would be mainly for the peace and relaxation I got from the place as it looked like a laid back...read more
Ordered their nut case and Nutella coffee magic. They have an awesome taste. Nut case had crunchy dry fruit peices in between.. just the right amount to complete the drink. I loved the package in glass bottles. Would want to taste all the flavours dey haveüòçüòç
Wanna get drunk with some healthy drinks with no added sugars? This is the place!
"A simple and nice place for healthy drinks with a really wide range of menu. I really like the ambience and the teaser of the drinks they serve. Just order your favourite drink sit back and grab some game(jenga, chess, UNO...etc.) provided here and spend some quality and healthy time with the drinks! Or if you would like to play some guitar, that's available too!"
"You'll find all the drinks tasty, sweet and lovely."
Don't know why they discontinued the food items. Can consider re-adding a few good healthy items to the menu. And prices are a little high to make drunken monkey a daily thing! Try to cut down the...read more
I have been there couple of times.
They have Jenga etc.. other stuff to play around till your order is served.
"Shakes, smoothies etc.. everything is amazing. They focus a lot on healthy drinks."

"I am a crazy lover of smoothies and always wanted to try out this place. This review is specific to the Kondapur branch. The place is small but not congested at all. The ambiance is quirky and I just fell in love with the beautiful quotes written there. For e.g. ""Today's Special...and so are you"" brought an instant smile to my face. They have a nice seating arrangement and the place can accommodate around 15-20 people. They have guitar, board games, tinkle to read as well. "
"To start with, we tried Hara Bhara Kebab which was cooked well and was good in taste, May be they can increase the size of the Kebabs or probably the quantity. Moving on the main part for...read more"
A small cosy place to indulge in juices. We had a decent experience. It was 5 of us. Good menu. And frozen fresh fruits used for the preparation. Loved the watermelon juice.
The juice I ordered was normal. Not exceptional like pricing.
May be a good to try. Taste was good but I didnt find it worth the price.
Worth trying.
"Small and cozy place. Mistaken it initially for a small drinking place and didn't go for quite long. Finally one day, while searching for a dessert place, ended here and was not disappointed at all. They have got good variety and you'll certainly find something suitable for you. Place is small so is managed pretty well and the quality of shakes and coffee was good. Overall, will come again for sure."
"I like going to this place because it does not have any visitors, its rare to find people here. Most of the orders are take away or home delivery. I like going to this place so i can spend time play zhenga nd ofcourse sip those healty drinks. Best way to kill time on a lazy evening."
Awesome place with nice ambience.
Best place to chill out with friends.
Best place i have visited till now.
My favourite smoothie brownie üòç
You can try other alsoüòÄ
"Been there twice. My first visit wasn't all that great as I found a hair in my shake and the second time, wanted to give them another chance to see if it was a one off. But then, the second visit was equally bad. Extremely delayed service and give a damn kind of attitude. Only saving grace was the board games that kept the kids occupied. I'd rather go to Thick shakes any day as they're far more responsive and hygienic."
"This place had themed interiors, was a bit small place , though comfy , we had ordered watermelon magic and grape juice , watermelon magic juice was quite diluted, grape was fine.. interiors and juices were fine, but it took half an hour for order but staff was quite friendly."
Nice outlet of one of the most easily recognisable juice station chain of the city. Ambiance appeals to me the most as it is quite out of the box and juices seemed to be made from fresh fruits and no extra water/sugar is added. But certainly it is not my everyday shop as I cannot gulp down 130 for a glass of watermelon.
"Went for the first time expecting some real fruit shakes, and It didn't dissapoint. Tried mango epic which is a mixture of ice cream mango strawberry and nuts. This really impressed me with its unique flavour. The service is really really slow, should improve on it, otherwise good place to be"
"It was a late hot summer evening, I decided to visit this place for some refreshing juices. Ordered mausambi magic and lime classic sweet salt, it literally took them half an hour to make 2 glasses of basic fruit juice. Thank god they had some board and card games to keep us occupied."
"The juices were very average, in fact the lime one was not even chilled. Don't think I will visit again given the fact that it is expensive too. In zomato, they have a snack menu but they didn't serve any food items. The ambience is good, I like the woody feeling and decor but still not impressed with the place."
I have been here twice and I really like the atmosphere at this store x The staff is very friendly.
**** Nut case **** my new favourites
"Real fruits, sugarless, mostly guilt-free - that's Drunken Monkey. Has been on my to-visit list for a while and I finally got to visit this weekend. The ambiance is welcoming, nice earthy shades with matching d√©cor and art. Looks cute. I ordered the Watermelon thickshake and it was yummy to the core. The prices are not really cheap but it's a good place to hangout or have a conversation over a shake :)"
"We were two and thought of visit this place. I expected coffee, ice cream and some other snacks but when I visited realised that only juice and varieties are available which matches it's tag line ON JUICE."
With a very pleasant ambiance and a capacity of 50 seating I suggest this as a very good hangout place which nearly costs 400-500‚Çπ per two people.
Service is good even though only one guy is maintaining the whole small cute outlet.
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Taste: 4/5
"The concept of a cafe for smoothies is very appealing and the food is good too, menu is limited but everything be it sandwiches, rice, smoothies were very good."
It's a perfect hangout zone with friends or for a quick fun date wth board games to play.
A big thumbs up to them!
"Quite place/ Not an eye catcher - Should hunt for it - Been here once - We were the only Customers - The A/C was switched ON, once we jumped IN. "
I liked their Madhapur outlet compared to this.
Had been here only once. I like the concept of it. But the place is very small and don't ask about the ambience. They serve juice items. Added benefit is the sugar less part of it. I personally like orange juice a lot. And was not very impressed with theirs. The price is on a high side along with taxes. One thing they have done the best is the logo. That monkey though.
Had this on my bucket list since a while.
"Walked in on a Saturday afternoon, and to my surprise it was completely empty though I loved the ambience !"
"I ordered a green grape juice and the mother ordered a chikoo shake, after ordering we perched ourselves up and started a game of scrabble(they have the board games) service was a bit slow, took around 30mins but the end result was fabulous ! Loved the juice it was so fresh and refreshing, and mums chikoo shake was no less.."
Just yummy and and oh so healthy !
We played our full game of around 2 hours here and by then the place started getting more customers.
Note : it's on the main road so it's has little or no parking.
"Nice place around the corner. Small but a well managed one. Ordered Watermelon Magic and Kitkat Caramel and both were awesome. Thick Shakes with quality ingredients and spot on flavours. One should try their healthy Shakes. Awesome flavour, Nice Ambience and worth the price. Will surely visit again."
Its a very interactive and cozy place.
Menu is great and healthy.
"You can read books, play games and chit chat. Kinda fun."
One thing which this place misses is quick bites to fill empty stomach.
One can't just drink and sit at one place without eating anything.
Staff is nice though.
I will visit again for some healthy drinks.
This place is very small but has a lot. They have a lot of healthy drinks.
"I tried the Oreo shake, which was really good."
But the choco Nutella is a bomb.
Haven't had such a heavenly thickshake in days!
This place is also very photogenic!
This place also has a lot of board games.
"This place seems cool and no sugar in drinks, caught my attention on the Gachibowli Miyapur Highway at Kondapur. Prices seems bit high but convinced with the place. As soon as the drinks float on my table, I just smiled for a while with the taxes and packaging charges included in a bill of already raised price tags. I don't think I will recommend any or comeback to this place again. Shearly disappointed."
"For starters parking is a real problem here and once you get in it gets quite exciting with the board games they have. They indeed should, to hold our patience until they take their own time to prepare the drinks. But after all this, they make lovely drinks. I really wonder if real fruits with no sugar could make such tasty drinks. The staff is quite courteous and would love to visit this place again."
"This branch of Drunken Monkey is comparatively new and has to go a lot way to become like the branch at Madhapur. The idea of healthy drinks appears to be good. The staffs need to more trained on cutomer service and I am sure, they would come up to be good."
Nice place and good ambience. The staff is cordial. The food quality is good and would like to visit the same place on my next visit to Hyderabad.
They have such an amazing menu but they fail to do justice to it mostly. I love the concept of healthy drinks but I get a bit skeptical when they go back into their kitchen to make it. How can I be sure they are not adding artificial sweeteners or even sugar in there?
"The place is small and cute and very easy to spot near Shilpa Park. The interiors are nice and they have board games that you can amuse yourself with. And this comes in very handy because they take quite some time to get your order. Both times I've been here, my order has come in 20-25 mins later at least. I feel that's a bit too long for a shake?"
I've tried the epic mango and the magic watermelon. The mango drink was good...read more
Yet to come up with the taste they are supposed to bring out. Place is awesome and the infra is really really good. Good custom made furniture around. Beverages are not up to the mark. Hope they make it better in the coming future.
Drunken monkey has been one of those new food franchise outlets I had tried out recently for lunch and in the evenings and had a good experience.
"This time however it was a not so good experience! Ordered mango ice cream epic, banana shake epic and chicken egg white tikka from this kondapur outlet which is quite closer to my place, just a 10 min walk distance. They did not have the mango ice cream which was a letdown, however they were in a hurry to replace it with anything on their mind rather than even trying to ask us for what we wanted, which was kinda rude and bad customer service. I had to request them for what they had instead and then asked for the king of hearts instead which is...read more"
I liked the place and the concept. Its a great place to hang out and chill. The juices here are really good. Ordered a chicken sandwitch which was fine.
"Probably the only place dedicated to healthy drinks only. They do have a very tiny food menu as well. So after hearing a lot of rave about this place dropped in for breakfast. Frankly I don't know what is all the rave about. Yes a lot of options for healthy smoothies but from my experience it dint taste as good as they made us picture from the menu description. We ordered dragon fruit classic and mango epic. Dragon fruit classic was very okayish but that is understandable as that's how it tastes and they do not add sugar to their drinks to keep it healthy. Mango epic was the one that disappointed me. It is supposed to be a blend of mango, apple, strawberry and nuts but all I could taste...read more"
"A really cool place to hang out with friends n colleagues. A very unique idea of spending healthy time of buddy chat. Being a regular visitor now to this place is obvious for 2 very sincere reasons: the variety of juice and flavours and you gotta play games n cards as well. Ambience, hygiene, service, pocket friendly n flavours to tingle... all top marks."
"For people residing nearby Kondapur and want to visit some place to hangout at night, do come here with your buddies; you will love it."
"Drunken monkey always gives you something to drink like a monkey. Can play some board games,play guitar,takes selfies , card games etc along with variety of juice combinations.Coming to menu, it is broadly colored with mixtures of juices and tastes with typical original tastes."
This is the newly opened branch for this funky franchise and the concept is as interesting as the name.
"You will certainly love the ambiance (same as previous 2 outlets) classy look, wooden chairs, health jargons involving monkey and board games (best part)...Not to forget free wi fi . Its new location is perfect for me and they will find me in regulars."
"Coolers and the drinks are amazing, you can always try new ones every day and probably finish the menu in 3 months, Varieties are nice in snacks and try new things while playing brain teasing scrabble (I suck at it). Staff is warm and will be tested in next couple of months before everything is set up and as famous as other 2."
Do visit...read more
